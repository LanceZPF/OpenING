With the swift electrification of automobiles globally, along with ongoing development in consumer electronics and energy storage applications, the demand for lithium-ion battery electrolytes and corresponding lithium salts is also rapidly growing. According to market forecast data, the global demand for primary lithium salt for electrolytes was 130,000 tons in 2022, and it is expected to reach 340,000 tons by 2025.\n\nIn recent years, due to increasing demands for lithium-ion batteries in terms of energy density, power density, calendar life, and safety features, the new lithium salt LiFSI has demonstrated significant advantages in ionic conductivity, chemical stability, and thermal stability. It is expected to gradually enter a demand explosion phase in the next five years. According to Zhongjin Qixin's forecast, as the high-nickel composition of ternary lithium batteries becomes an important development trend, this trend will drive the growth of LiFSI demand. Additionally, the application of LiFSI in the lithium iron phosphate battery field is also expected to grow rapidly.\n\nAccording to market data, by 2025, the global demand for lithium-ion battery electrolytes is projected to be 2.6 million tons, with the corresponding demand for primary lithium salt in electrolytes reaching 340,000 tons. As LiFSI commercializes quickly, its market penetration rate is expected to increase rapidly. If LiFSI achieves a 50% market penetration rate in the future, its market demand in 2025 will reach 170,000 tons. Concurrently, calculations by Zhongjin Qixin project that, considering only the power battery sector, the market demand for LiFSI in 2025 could reach approximately 160,000 tons. Overall, based on consistent market predictions, the demand for LiFSI by 2025 is expected to be no less than 160,000 tons.\n\nMoreover, the rise in demand for LiFSI will concurrently drive the demand for lithium salt additives like LiODFB and LiBF4. On one hand, using LiODFB with LiFSI can inhibit the corrosion of LiFSI on aluminum current collectors, and on the other hand, these lithium salt additives in electrolytes can further enhance the performance of lithium batteries. The global demand for lithium salt additives was 20,000 tons in 2022 and is expected to rise to 63,000 tons by 2025, maintaining a rapid growth trend.",

Then, my unrelated older brother arrived. The two of us walked to the doorway. I sat on a stool at the doorway while my brother got into an argument with three strangers.

Then I ran over and killed the two people being pinned down by my brother, and they were also covered in blood.\n\nThen my uncle came over and saw what had happened. He bound one hand of mine and one hand of my brother's (the one not related by blood) with a hair tie to the table. Some details are forgotten here too. Afterwards, somehow, my friends and I went to play and ended up at a cemetery. It turned out to be the grave of one of the people I had killed with the stone.

Then, it was as if someone whispered in my ear, saying that it always needs to be repaid, so just let it be. Then I woke up.\n\n[End of dream]",

During the conference, I met many prominent figures and chatted happily with them. There were also some minor events that we participated in together. My advisor was also there, and they asked me to do some work.\n\nMy advisor left early. After I finished my tasks and the conference ended, I and my groupmates took care of the after-conference matters before boarding a high-speed train to return home. \n\nOn the way back, midway through the trip, we were informed that the train service was suspended due to a heavy snowstorm.\n\nInitially, I was indifferent about this situation. \n\nHowever, my advisor urgently wanted me to attend a meeting and work online. I explained to him that I was stuck on the way due to the road blockage. He wasn’t pleased. I said I wouldn't do it. He was very disappointed and said he didn’t have any good students, unlike other groups that have several good students, which is why they developed so quickly.\n\nUpon hearing this, I got very angry and bombarded my advisor with voice messages, severely criticizing him. I scolded him by saying there are not so many good students falling from the sky like a pie. It's actually very difficult for anyone to get good students. In reality, most students' levels are rather average, so it's about the teachers’ ability to educate them. The reason why those teachers developed so quickly is that they know how to teach well. Even if the students are not outstanding, they can bring out their potential. They possess high teaching levels, whereas you do not teach effectively and always dream of a pie falling from the sky. Reflect on your own teaching and guidance skills. \n\nI then gave examples, saying Professor A is known to be a good teacher and was promoted to dean at Harbin Institute of Technology in Shenzhen; Professor B, the deputy director of our institute, managed to guide students from third-tier universities to successfully get into Stanford for a Ph.D.; Professor C, who is even younger than you, can teach well and received the Excellent Young Scientists Fund, but you didn't; Professor D also developed in such a manner and gained a reputation, making many students eager to join.\n\nBut for you, no one wants to come unless there's no other choice.\n\nReflect on this seriously.

This settlement could symbolize inner peace or a kind of safe haven.\n\nDescending and Large Steps: Encountering steps half the height of a person while descending the mountain might signify some difficulties or obstacles you face when achieving your goals or extricating from challenges. This detail might symbolize the weight and hardship you feel at the end of a journey.\n\nFire Meteor Scene: The sudden appearance of a fire meteor in the dream could reflect your anxiety about sudden changes or crises in the future. The fire meteor represents significant changes or uncontrollable forces, possibly indicating your subconscious fear of certain unmanageable events.\n\nOverall, this dream reveals your inner state when facing life's peaks and valleys. You might be going through a period filled with challenges and uncertainties, but at the same time, you are exploring new possibilities. The appearance of the fire meteor serves as a reminder that sudden changes or crises may occur in life, and you need to stay alert and prepared.",

Here is the content of my dream:\n\nI dreamt of a virus far more terrifying than COVID-19, perceived as the end of human civilization. Initially, cities and schools were locked down, followed by a period of chaos and turmoil, with undercurrents surging as people formed secret societies and clandestine factions. I encountered many strange occurrences outside the dormitory building, like absurd news stories, people inexplicably entering despite the lockdown, conflicts, and how I ended up mingling with some wayward friends and even managed to recruit some staff, like the dormitory supervisor, into our group. This group, along with some outsiders, committed numerous illegal acts.\n\nThen, resources ran short, and we were on the verge of starvation. We followed the gang to ransack a supermarket, and a particularly large one sprouted up within the campus. The entrance resembled the layout of stores like Hema Fresh, with a very large restaurant serving Western-style dishes high in protein and carbohydrates, cooked in huge iron pots (post-apocalyptic elements). It was evident that we couldn't afford any of it. As we rampantly looted in the supermarket, others prioritized grabbing premium wines and imported foods, while I, carrying two large bags, was still concerned about arranging breakfast for the next day. So, I grabbed a pile of marinated eggs, several boxes of instant noodles, and haphazardly grabbed some snacks from the puffed foods section (noticing that other shelves were empty, but this section was untouched). \n\nEventually, my accomplices all left and headed to the restaurant entrance to eat. Being slow in my selection, I left later while still contemplating on whether to take a large or medium-sized backpack from the supermarket entrance. Approaching the entrance, I saw my roommate at one of the three counters in the restaurant, ordering food. After he moved away, I told the cashier that I was with the person before me and inquired what he ordered. He seemed to have ordered an XX lamb pot, so I ordered an XX beef pot.\n\nUpon leaving, my mentor called me, inquiring about the situation at the school. He seemed eager to come in to seek refuge and also questioned how outsiders managed to get in. I secretly mocked his ignorance (he previously asked why Russia shouldn't launch attacks easily during a group meeting), thinking these intruders possessed martial skills beyond his imagination. Subsequently, loudspeakers broadcasted an announcement that a thorough purge would be conducted within the campus to expel all outsiders. I was worried about a girl I knew who had snuck in using a lightfoot martial art technique.\n\n---\n\nNote: For symbols like \"XX\" where specifics were less clear in your request, I've left placeholders.

I experimented and found that after spitting out the insects, if they didn’t receive my command, they would automatically return to my stomach, and they would suddenly vanish. Then, I felt a movement in my throat, and they had gone back (I clearly had my mouth closed!). I felt no discomfort. Later, I fought with some friends against vicious dogs, three in total. I fought the biggest one, but oddly, when I tried to spit out insects for assistance, only five or six came out, which was useless. I had to fight it with my fists and feet, but the dog’s bones were very hard, and despite hitting it for a long time, nothing happened.

This suggests that you may be worried about your father's health or loneliness. This dream likely reflects your inner concern for your father and thoughts about his living conditions.\n- Inscription on the Door: Inscriptions expressing mourning are typically used to convey sorrow and remembrance. Their appearance in the dream might indicate your mourning for certain things or relationships from the past, or feelings of guilt over unfulfilled responsibilities or emotions.\n- Taking a Shortcut and Facing a Blockade: You chose a remote shortcut but found it ultimately impassable. This could symbolize that in real life, you have tried some unusual paths or decisions, but the outcomes did not meet your expectations. The closed path might represent obstacles or dilemmas you have encountered in certain matters, necessitating a reassessment and adjustment of your direction.\n- Symbolism of the Train Station: Train stations often symbolize transitions or journeys, implying changes or new phases in life. The fact that you were unable to reach the train station smoothly in the dream might mean that you feel uncertain or uneasy about certain changes in your future.\n\nThis dream is filled with memories of the past and confusion about the future, while also revealing your deep concern for your family, particularly your father. The obstacles and detours in the dream might serve as a reminder that sometimes shortcuts in life are not the best choices; perhaps a slower pace and taking an alternate path towards the goal is necessary.",

I remember that road had a rural, primitive feel to it, and it wasn't the road we normally take to go home in real life. There were hardly any pedestrians, just the occasional truck passing by. Later, at a corner, we took a small path uphill (seemingly the only way home in the dream, although it was completely different from our actual way home). On either side of the path were old houses made of stone, stretching in clusters. The path seemed to end at a mountain, though blocked by the houses, you could vaguely sense it. Because it was evening, there was an eerie feeling.\n\nAs we walked, suddenly a pale yellow dog emerged from a very narrow alley. It didn't look frightening at all, not like a vicious dog, but it kept barking, which made me a bit scared, so I instinctively hid behind my boyfriend. My boyfriend seemed to take this path often, so he said, \"Don’t be afraid, this dog is tied to a leash, it's safe.\" To reassure me, he stepped forward to scare the dog. But suddenly, just as he took a few steps forward, the dog lunged out. The leash was still on, but it was very long, giving the dog plenty of room to move. Before he could react, the dog's teeth were already around his head. I saw him struggling, in pain and unable to breathe. I was stunned, but I quickly thought to find a long stick and started hitting the dog with all my might. Maybe I was too scared or maybe it was because it was a dream, hitting the dog felt like hitting something soft and powerless. Watching my boyfriend being swallowed slowly like a snake devouring its prey, I felt anxious and helpless. In the remote area, there was no time to find help, but I couldn't help on my own either. As I watched his body being completely swallowed, I felt utterly helpless. Just then, turning at the corner, I suddenly saw a middle-aged man standing there.

He realized that life evolves gradually and that modern organisms are the result of the evolution of earlier ones. This led him to question whether ancient legends about spontaneous generation might be problematic.\n\nWith these thoughts in mind, Pasteur began his experiments. He used two types of flasks (the swan-neck flask and the straight-neck flask), placing meat broth in them, and sterilized both the broth and the flasks by heating them. The meat broth boiled in the swan-neck flask did not come into contact with airborne bacteria and remained unspoiled for four years. In contrast, the broth in the straight-neck flask quickly went bad.\n\nThese results demonstrated that nothing, not even bacteria, arises spontaneously. Pasteur's experiments and insights quickly gained public acceptance. Moreover, his discovery highlighted that wound infections and disease transmission were caused by bacteria. Consequently, methods of disinfection and prevention became widespread in the medical community.",

A precise pass from the midfield allowed the Arsenal forward to break through the defense, skillfully maneuvering past a defender before confidently striking the ball into the corner of the net. The stadium erupted in cheers as the home team took the lead.\n\n2. **Second Goal Moment:**\n   - **Description:** In the second half, Arsenal doubled their lead with a well-executed set-piece. A beautifully curved free-kick from the edge of the penalty area left the opposing goalkeeper without a chance as it sailed into the top corner of the goal. This secured the victory for Arsenal, delighting the fans with a display of technical excellence. \n\nThese moments not only highlighted Arsenal's offensive prowess but also set a positive tone for their season ahead.",

Manipulation of Desires:\nThe captors engineer their prisoners' emotions and bodily reactions. Tennant feels an implanted desire for Dana, a cruel tool to subvert natural human connections into scientific curiosities for their captors.\n\n**Sample Confliction:**\nIn the heptagonal central hall, Tennant watched Olga sway to a polka tune.

It was their ultimate form of resistance, a weapon their captors could neither predict nor entirely control.\n \nThese elements should mesh into a cohesive narrative that explores the psychological landscapes of captivity, the power of subtle defiance, and the human spirit’s resilience under alien manipulation.",

I just about lose it.   Why can't anyone understand?   There's a reason I'm never sick, a reason so twisted you'd think it came from a horror story.   But it's real.   It's as real as the sun rising and setting.   I've always been healthy, impossibly so—never a cold, never a cough.   It isn't luck or clean living.\n\nNo, it's them.    The Hexers.    Otherworldly entities who've marked my life for some kind of bizarre penance.    They’ve made sure I stay healthy, but at what cost?    My parents once told me I was special, but I don't think they knew how right they were—if only they knew the torment concealed behind this perfect health.\n\nMy earliest memories are of being blamed for things I never did, punished for crimes that weren't mine.    My dad locked me in a dark room as part of my punishment, never aware that the darkness was the least of my fears.    The real terror was what lurked in that darkness, what whispered from unseen corners.    They never believed me when I told them about the monsters.\n\nAs an adult, I’ve learned to hide my fears, but they never left.    I've been punished, not for what I did in this life, but for unknown sins in some twisted continuum of existence.    They’ve got me shackled to an existence where health is my curse, not a blessing.\n\nThis isn't just paranoia.    No, I know it's the work of the Hexers, beings from another plane who can manipulate lives across time.    Modern machinery, ancient grudges—all of it aimed at me.    No matter how hard I try to escape this twisted game, they’ve rigged it so I can never break free.    And now, the only way out—the only way to stop the madness and reclaim some control over my life—is by understanding and outsmarting them.\n\nMy name is William Hagle, and this is my story.    The tale of a man, perfectly healthy, caught in a cosmic game of revenge.”",

But Voss was closer now, his presence a fierce, unyielding menace.\n\nSettling briefly in a cave, Xera calmed her nerves and planned. The hunt was not a mere game now; it was a matter of survival and honor. Her resolve hardened as she watched Voss, a distant silhouette beneath the star-studded sky, moving ever closer. \n\nTime was of the essence.

This old case bears significant similarities to the present one, catching the attention of veteran officer Wei Zhengrong (played by Chen Jianbin), who was in charge of the original case. The mentor and disciple duo decide to collaborate on a cross-temporal investigation to unveil the shocking truth.\n\nThe narrative unfolds across two intertwined timelines: one is the investigation in 2008, and the other is the events of the unresolved case from 13 years earlier. This interwoven storytelling method not only increases the complexity and suspense of the plot but also delves deeply into the relationships and emotional changes of the characters. Despite their age and ideological differences, Wei Zhengrong and Yang Zhe are both diligent and responsible policemen. Throughout the investigation, they must confront external pressures and challenges, as well as handle their inner struggles and emotional conflicts.\n\nIf you are a fan of suspense and crime genres, this series is definitely worth watching.",

Ultimately, Baishun pondered that a woman running away with a man must have been moved by that particular sentence. However, I believe what moved her might not have been a single sentence, but possibly an event. When life is dull, it's easy to be swayed by charm; when life is down and out, it's easy to be tempted by wealth. So, I don't think it necessarily was that sentence.\n\nI feel deceived by the book's title. I originally came to find answers because I naturally dislike talking and prefer concise speech. Nonetheless, reading through it gave me some insights. Baishun's efforts were quite commendable. Though the outcome wasn't ideal, at least losing Qiaoling must have felt like the sky collapsing for him at certain moments. However, his final reckoning could be considered a peaceful end.\n\nOverall, it felt like a cycle, as if certain events are predestined and unrelated to your plans, or it doesn't matter whether you have a plan or not—an outcome already awaits you. \n\nI read it over approximately five days, totaling 11 hours, and during Baishun's preparation to kill Old Ma, I immersed myself for four hours straight. It was extremely captivating, with consistent themes throughout. Initially, the multitude of characters was confusing; I struggled to distinguish who was who, as everyone had only a surname and the prefix “Old.” From the moment Baishun learned to slaughter pigs, the main storyline gradually became clear. I greatly admire Teacher Liu's ability to create characters—so many names and surnames, and how he imagined them. Each character should have a prototype. The meticulous arrangement of these characters is remarkable, demonstrating his organizational skills.\n\nThe writing style of this book is also distinct. For instance, it describes a person with three friends, then elaborates on each one of them. However, while discussing the first friend, other events are gradually intertwined, appearing chaotic but actually forming a clear line when viewed holistically. After a while, the narrative suddenly circles back to the beginning and starts another main storyline.\n\nThe book didn't strike me as humorous; rather, it felt more like helplessness and sorrow. The helplessness stems from the feeling that no matter what you do, you can't achieve what you want. Looking back, many years have passed. We're like water in a small river, seemingly rushing freely, but the final route is the same, almost as if everything is preplanned. The sorrow comes from the protagonist's constant evasion. With nowhere to live, he runs dozens of miles daily. He was expelled from his apprenticeship for gossiping, slapped by a monkey while fetching water, followed Old Zhan and changed his name but still couldn't find himself. After finally getting married, he lost even his surname. His wife ran away, and even if that was bearable, in the end, he lost the only thing he cherished—Qiaoling. I don't know how he survived, but even if he were a piece of wood, he must have contemplated death at some point.\n\nI recommend everyone read it. The vernacular is easy to understand, and there's no need to overly concern yourself with the complex relationships since the author will always recapitulate them when the character reappears.",

He understands the truth and does not judge Zheng Juan with prejudice. Meanwhile, he is a long-standing Party member who has worked tirelessly at the forefront of the country's construction. Even after retirement, he continues to contribute.\n\nLi Sihua: Single-handedly raised three children with great hardship. The entire burden of the family rested on Li Sihua. Due to the incident concerning Zhou Rong and her husband, she was traumatized and fell into a coma for two years. After waking up, she could only recognize her closest family members.\n\nZhou Bingyi: Essentially, he is a person who values affection and loyalty, adheres to principles, and understands love and gratitude. As the mayor of Jichun City, he made significant contributions to the hometown’s reforms.\n\nSpouse: Hao Dongmei - The daughter of a high-ranking official. After marrying Bingyi, she served as the head of the surgery department in a hospital.\n\nZhou Rong: Courageously pursues love; she has been independent, strong-willed, and rebellious since childhood. She fell in love with a poet and, to follow her love, she defied her family’s opposition and left home. During those times, she was an independent woman who dared to love and hate; in today's context, one might call her a person driven by emotions.\n\nEx-Husband: Feng Youcai - During their time in Guizhou, he was a downtrodden poet looked down upon by others. Zhou Rong followed him to remote mountains in Guizhou to teach. After they returned to Jichun City, Feng Youcai cheated on her, and they divorced. This is a typical example of people who can endure hardships together but can't share happiness. Many years later, he became a monk.\n\nSpouse: Cai Xiaoguang - Zhou Rong’s childhood friend. Sincere by nature, his affection for the Zhou family is evident. After Zhou Rong divorced Feng Youcai, Cai Xiaoguang expressed his desire to marry her. He is arguably my favorite character in the book.\n\nZhou Bingkun: A diligent grassroots worker. As a small person of the lower strata, he is somewhat timid and avoids trouble. However, he is responsible for his family and children and always cares for his friends. He is a true representation of most lower-class individuals of that era.\n\nSpouse: Zheng Juan - Abandoned as a child, she was adopted by a woman selling ice lollies. She was violated by Mianhou and subsequently gave birth to Zhou Nan. After meeting Zhou Bingkun, she started a new life, but then Bingkun was unfortunately imprisoned. She took on the responsibility of taking care of the entire Zhou family. Her life was unfortunate, but meeting Bingkun was a blessing.",

In the context of political upheaval characterized by warlord conflicts, severe destruction of rural economies, intensified imperialist aggression, and an unprecedented crisis in Chinese national industry and commerce, the Chinese national bourgeoisie, ultimately, could only face the historical fate of either becoming comprador bourgeoisie or going bankrupt in their struggle against the comprador bourgeoisie supported by imperialists and domestic reactionaries.

There are many exercises you can do to help increase your arm muscle mass and strength:\n\nPractice one-arm lat pulldowns. You will need to train on a high-pulley machine or cable machine to perform this exercise, which involves pulling a weighted handle down to your chest. Start with a comfortable weight (which will vary depending on your fitness level) and aim for no more than two to three repetitions using 20% or 30% more than your body weight. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, aim to complete 2-3 repetitions lifting 180-195 pounds. Make sure to work both arms evenly during each training session.\n\nTry the bench press. Bench pressing exercises your chest and arms, both of which are involved in proper pull-up execution. If you lack arm strength or you're not familiar with the weight you can handle, you can start with just the barbell. Gradually increase the weight over 3-5 weeks to build muscle mass and strength.\n\nMaster push-ups. Push-ups work your arms, chest, and back, helping to strengthen the arms for pull-ups. Once you have mastered regular push-ups, progress to learning the one-arm push-up and ensure you master it with both arms.",

In fact, the serratus anterior (SA), located underneath the shoulder blades, works to stabilize all the muscles needed for pull-ups. If your posture is not correctly aligned, your shoulder blades will become misaligned, making performing pull-ups nearly impossible, regardless of how strong your arms are.\n\nStart by softening the SA and surrounding muscles. Use a dowel, tennis ball, or foam roller to release tension, positioning your muscles correctly. Lie on a mat or rubber floor, or lean against a wall, and firmly roll the ball against the pectoral muscles (chest), teres major (upper back and underarms), and SA muscles. Begin by gently rolling and then increase the pressure on tender spots.\n\nStrengthen your back by focusing on back exercises, especially those targeting the SA muscles, such as Downward Dog, push-ups, reverse flys, and cable rows.",

You can also try widening your grip to work on your back muscles.\n\nOnce you have mastered the regular pull-up, you can introduce a new challenge by lifting yourself with both arms but lowering yourself with only one arm, alternating arms with each pull.

Therefore, the duration of the workout depends on the number of exercises, sets, and repetitions you perform, as well as the rest periods in between. It is recommended to perform 6 to 12 repetitions per set.\n\nUsually, the number of repetitions you perform and the rest time between sets depends on what you aim to achieve. For example:\n\n- Muscle strength: Perform fewer sets with heavier weights and take longer rest periods in between (2 to 5 minutes).\n- Hypertrophy (increasing muscle size): Work to fatigue with moderate to high volume, gradually increasing weight weekly, with 60 to 90 seconds rest in between.\n- Muscular endurance: Perform higher numbers of repetitions at your capacity with shorter rest periods (20 to 120 seconds).\n\nIf you easily become bored or fatigued, focus on smaller muscle groups during each training session to reduce your time in the gym. For instance, work on arms for 20 minutes one day and legs for 20 minutes another day.\n\nTaking all this into account, a weightlifting session can last from 20 to 60 minutes, depending on the exercises and repetitions you perform during training.",

Although drowning can indeed happen, most incidents can be prevented through simple safety measures. Whenever you swim, follow the guidelines below to greatly reduce the risk of drowning:\n\nDo not swim alone. Always swim with another competent swimmer if no other people are around. Areas with lifeguards are typically the best places to swim.\n\nDo not swim in moving water initially. If you are learning to swim in the ocean or rivers, you need to be more aware of the water's movements. If you must learn to swim in such conditions, try to ensure you are with someone who knows what they are doing and be sure to read up on steps for escaping rip currents or fast-flowing rivers (as outlined below).\n\nUse appropriate safety gear until you have sufficient water experience and feel relatively comfortable in the water.\n\nStay within depths you can manage. When you first learn how to swim, do not venture into water too deep for you to stand in. This way, if any issue arises, you can simply stand up to breathe.\n\nAvoid swimming in severe weather conditions. Swimming in light rain should be fine, but if you see or hear a storm approaching, exit the water immediately. Follow this rule regardless of your swimming ability.\n\nDo not swim in overly cold water. If you are in cold water, paddling with your limbs may suddenly become difficult.\n\nAvoid drinking alcohol before or while swimming. Alcohol impairs judgment, balance, and coordination, which increases the risk of drowning.",

Practice doing this on both your stomach and your back until you get used to having half of your body float.\n\nOnce you're ready, try floating on your back or stomach. Stay at a shallow depth so that if it doesn't work, you can simply stand up. When your nose and mouth are in the air and water surrounds your ears, it might feel strange, but you'll get used to it. For additional stability, extend your arms out at right angles to form a \"T\" shape with your body. The first time you float, you can try taking a deep breath before floating.

This campaign lasted from 230 BCE, when Qin attacked Han, to 221 BCE, when it conquered Qi, spanning a total of ten years. Qin sequentially annihilated Han, Zhao, Wei, Chu, Yan, and Qi, bringing an end to more than 500 years of feudal division and conflict that had persisted since the Spring and Autumn period, and establishing the first centralized monarchical state in Chinese history, the Qin Dynasty.\n\nIn 238 BCE, Qin King Zheng eradicated the faction led by Prime Minister Lü Buwei and Marquis of Changxin, Na Poison, initiating his rule personally and meticulously planning the war to unify the six states. Qin's strategy for the conquest of the six states had two components. First, they adopted the strategy proposed by Wei Liao to break the alliances of the six states: \"Do not prize wealth, bribe influential ministers, disrupt their plans,\" thereby internally disintegrating enemy states. Second, they inherited the policy of forming distant alliances while attacking nearby states, establishing specific strategic steps to first conquer the weak and then the strong, starting nearby and then moving farther away. Li Si suggested attacking Han and Zhao first: \"If Zhao falls, Han perishes; if Han perishes, Chu and Wei cannot stand alone. If Chu and Wei cannot stand alone, then in one stroke we can overthrow Han, weaken Wei, and uproot Chu, moving eastward to weaken Qi and Yan.\"\n\nAfter conquering the six states, Qin began campaigns against the Baiyue in the south in 219 BCE. During the unification process, Qin dispatched hundreds of thousands of people from the interior to the south for defense, bringing advanced production techniques and tools to the region, thus facilitating local development. They also constructed roads, notably digging the Lingqu Canal, which connected the Yangtze River and Pearl River systems, playing a crucial role in the economic and cultural exchange between the central and southern regions.\n\nFollowing wars against the Xiongnu and Baiyue, the Qin territory reached unprecedented size, extending east to the sea, west to Lintao, \"south to Beixianghu (possibly implying an area in modern Guangdong or Guangxi), north to the river as a border, and from Yinshan to Liaodong,\" making it the largest country in the world at the time.\n\nQin's unification of China ended the prolonged era of feudal warfare and division that began in the Spring and Autumn period, establishing the first centralized state in Chinese history. Qin's unification provided the people with a relatively stable environment to engage in production. The Qin Dynasty implemented many measures to eliminate factors causing division, laying the foundation for long-term unification in China, with profound and far-reaching impacts on Chinese historical development.\n\nFor a long time, Chinese society, with its highly developed economy and culture, stood at the forefront of world civilization and effectively resisted foreign invasions, maintaining national independence. This achievement is historically inseparable from the pioneering efforts of Qin's unification.",

Ultimately, the Soviet Union delivered 17 submarines, 1 destroyer, 1 cruiser, and 1 frigate to Pepsi.

In terms of politics, he accepted the suggestion of Zhu Fu Yan and issued the \"Order of Tuien,\" which weakened the power of the fiefdoms established at the beginning of the Han Dynasty, strengthened centralization, and enhanced the supervisory system.

From the Battle of Mayi in 133 BCE, he ended the marriage alliance policy with the Xiongnu which had been in place since the reign of Emperor Gaozu and began formally declaring war on the Xiongnu. He successively dispatched generals Li Guang, Wei Qing, and Huo Qubing to launch expeditions, eliminating the Xiongnu threat, reclaiming the Hetao and Hexi Corridor regions, expanding the Western Territory, and placing the Xiongnu in a subordinate position.

To the north, the Xiongnu were defeated, recovering the Hetao region and establishing the commanderies of Wuyuan and Shuofang. In the west, the Han conquered the Hexi Corridor, setting up the commanderies of Wuwei, Jiuquan, Zhangye, and Dunhuang, and built the Outer Great Wall stretching to the Gobi Desert at fortresses such as Juyan and Guanglu. The western expedition to Dayuan resulted in the submission of various Western Region states, thus establishing the basic territorial extent of Han China.\n\nIn the realm of thought: The Han dynasty adopted Dong Zhongshu's suggestion to reject all other schools of thought and exclusively advocate Confucianism, making it the dominant ideology of Chinese society. The Imperial University (Taixue) was established in Chang'an. Confucian doctrine became the orthodox ideology of China's feudal governance for over two thousand years, profoundly influencing subsequent Chinese politics, society, and culture.\n\nHistorians such as Sima Qian, Ban Gu, and Sima Guang believed that Emperor Wu of Han vigorously enforced centralization, expanded territories, and promoted Confucianism, making significant indelible contributions in history. However, in the latter part of his reign, due to his personal pursuit of grand achievements, indulgence in extravagance, superstition, cruelty, and excessive militarism, the Han empire experienced substantial declines in national strength, social economy, and population. The people suffered greatly during this period, enduring immense hardships and turmoil.

After the unification of Qin, Emperor Qin Shi Huang appointed Meng Tian as the main commander, leading troops to garrison Shang County, manage the northern frontier defenses, and safeguard the safety of the Qin capital, Xianyang. Meng Tian then began over a decade of border defense. On the other hand, Emperor Qin Shi Huang ordered the renovation of the Great Wall. The border between the Qin Dynasty and northern minority groups like the Xiongnu extended for thousands of miles, making it impractical to station troops everywhere. The Xiongnu were primarily cavalry, which gave them high mobility. To better defend against the Xiongnu incursions, Emperor Qin Shi Huang ordered the comprehensive restoration of the existing Great Wall sections built by Qin, Zhao, and Yan, connecting them to form an extensive Great Wall stretching from Lin Tao in the west to Liaodong in the east.\n\nMeng Tian's victory in the northern attacks against the Xiongnu not only effectively halted the plundering by Xiongnu slave-owning aristocrats but also further promoted the development of the region. Through long-term interactions and labor, a large number of Xiongnu migrated southward to the Central Plains, gradually cohabiting and producing with the Qin people and other ethnic groups, fostering significant ethnic integration. The northern assault on the Xiongnu reclaimed the Hetao region, making it a permanent part of China's territory. Additionally, while repelling the Xiongnu in the north, in 219 BCE and 214 BCE, Emperor Qin Shi Huang launched two wars against the Baiyue, constructed the Lingqu Canal, and developed the Lingnan region, incorporating it into China's territory for the first time.",

The purpose of the battle was to punish the Grand Duchy of Moscow for its disobedience.\n\nThe Russian forces formed a crescent-shaped formation with Donskoy at the center and Andrey from Polotsk on the flank.

Faced with the formidable offensive of Former Qin, internal conflicts within the Eastern Jin temporarily eased, allowing them to confront the enemy. The Prime Minister, Xie An, calmly commanded the defenses and ordered Xie Shi, Xie Xuan, and others to lead 80,000 troops from the Northern Army to the Huai River frontlines to resist.\n\nDespite their numerical disadvantage, Jin forces achieved an early victory, greatly boosting their morale. Meanwhile, the Qin army became disunited, and the soldiers grew weary of the war. Taking advantage of the internal chaos within the Qin army, the Jin forces launched a fierce attack across the Fei River, delivering a crushing defeat to the Qin army. Fu Jian was wounded by a stray arrow and fled alone on horseback.\n\nThe idioms \"throwing a whip to break the flow,\" \"the grass and trees are all soldiers,\" and \"the wind and crane sound\" all originated from the Battle of Fei River.\n\nReasons for Former Qin’s Defeat\n\nThe disastrous defeat of Former Qin at the Battle of Fei River can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, Fu Jian's arrogance, subjective arbitrariness, refusal to heed advice, and impetuous decision-making led to rash actions. Internal instability, disunity, and loyalty concerns among surrendered generals caused fluctuations in morale. The excessively long battlefront dispersed forces, leading to a lack of coordination. An initial setback undermined their confidence, and combined with ignorance of military intelligence, arbitrary retreats, and self-induced disarray, they presented opportunities for the enemy. Additionally, they failed to detect the espionage activities of Zhu Xu and others, allowing their opponents to gain crucial information, thus placing themselves in a passive position.\n\nReasons for Eastern Jin’s Victory\n\nThe victory of the Eastern Jin army can be attributed to several key factors: maintaining composure in the face of danger, calmly confronting the enemy; harmonious relations between the ruler and ministers, and dedicated soldiers; capable leadership with resolute command; accurate intelligence on the enemy, knowing both the enemy and themselves; well-trained soldiers, with the Northern Army being exceptionally effective; leveraging the advantages of time and terrain, maximally exploiting their strengths; achieving early victories that demoralized the enemy while bolstering their own morale; using strategy to provoke the enemy into disorder, then seizing the opportunity to strike; and resolutely pursuing strategic offensives to expand their gains.",

Meanwhile, the Eastern Jin continued for several more decades.\n\nIn the long run, the most significant impact of the Battle of Fei River was that it allowed the Han Chinese culture of the Central Plains to continue and develop after being displaced southward. This cultural continuity directly influenced the spiritual essence of subsequent unified dynasties like the Sui and Tang. It can be said that the Battle of Fei River preserved the core elements of Chinese culture, providing it with an opportunity to recuperate and reemerge following the turmoil caused by the Five Barbarians' invasion of China.",

King You of Zhou tried various ways to make her smile but to no avail. King You set up beacon towers and large drums to summon troops when enemies approached.

            "caption": "The campaign against the Three Miao refers to a large-scale war that took place over 4,000 years ago between the northern Huaxia tribal alliance, led by Yu, and the southern Three Miao tribal alliance. The conflict was over the control of slaves and living space. Through this war, Yu successfully eliminated his competitors who posed a threat to his own position, directly facilitating the birth of the Xia Dynasty.\n\nThe term \"Three Miao\" has both broad and narrow interpretations. Broadly, it refers to the Miao-Barbarian group, while narrowly, it refers to a faction recorded in the \"Strategies of the Warring States,\" which fought against Yao, Shun, and Yu. \"In ancient times, the residence of the Three Miao was bordered by the waves of Poyang Lake to the left, the waters of Dongting Lake to the right, with Wen Mountain to the south and Heng Mountain to the north.\" This denotes the entire activity region of the Miao-Barbarian group. Poyang and Dongting refer to the later Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, respectively. Heng Mountain, as mentioned in the \"Annotations on the Water Classic,\" is located in Zhixian (now south of Nanzhao County, Henan Province) in the Zhiheng Mountain area. The exact location of Wen Mountain is unclear, but it is known that before Yao, Shun, and Yu's expedition against the Three Miao, the Miao-Barbarian's dwelling was between Dongting and Poyang Lakes, with the northern boundary at the southern foothills of the Funiu Mountains, encompassing the entire Nanyang Basin.\n\nWith the victory against the Three Miao, the Longshan culture of Henan entered the Nanyang region, alleviating the southern threat and opening a pathway for the southward expansion of the Central Plains culture. This played a crucial role in the later development of the Central Plains dynasties. The war against the Three Miao further illustrated a shift in the nature of primitive warfare; no longer motivated by bloodline revenge, it became a war of conquest aimed at seizing strategically vital land suitable for survival and development. The defeated's ancestral temples were razed to the ground, their sacrificial vessels burned, and the captives and their descendants were enslaved, as stated, \"Their ancestral temples were destroyed, sacrificial vessels burned, and descendants made slaves.\" This exacerbated various social conflicts, ultimately dismantling the old clan system and paving the way for the establishment of the Xia Dynasty.",

He commanded numerous regional leaders and claimed to follow the mandate of heaven, which indicated that he had attained supreme royal authority and the title of \"Hou of Xia.\" Through these military campaigns, Yu continuously strengthened his royal power.\n\nTo further consolidate his authority, Yu proceeded south along the Ying River and convened a grand assembly at Mount Tu, located in the middle reaches of the Huai River (near present-day Huaiyuan County, west suburb of Bengbu, Anhui Province). The leaders of various states and tribes from the Xia and Yi regions attended this meeting, which was historically referred to as the Assembly at Mount Tu.\n\nAfter the assembly, the tribal leaders frequently came to the capital to present \"gold\" (bronze) as a tribute. Over time, the quantity of bronze tributes from the nine regions increased annually. Yu remembered the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan's achievement of casting tripods for commemoration. To commemorate the Assembly at Mount Tu, Yu decided to cast several large tripods from the tributes provided by the regional lords. However, to avoid potential resentment from the lords, Yu carefully considered and decided to use the bronze contributed by each region to cast a tripod for that specific region, engraving the topographical features of each region on the respective tripod. Additionally, various rare treasures, mythical animals, and supernatural beings encountered during his flood control efforts were also engraved on the tripods.\n\nA few months later, in the fifth year of Yu's reign, the nine grand tripods were cast. They included the Jizhou Tripod, Yanzhou Tripod, Qingzhou Tripod, Xuzhou Tripod, Yangzhou Tripod, Jingzhou Tripod, Yuzhou Tripod, Liangzhou Tripod, and Yongzhou Tripod. Each tripod bore the engravings of various geographical features, rare birds, and mythical beasts. The nine tripods symbolized the nine regions, with the Yuzhou Tripod being the central one, as Yuzhou served as the central hub. The nine tripods were centralized in the capital city, Yangcheng, of the Xia Dynasty, showcasing that Yu had become the ruler of the nine regions and signifying the unification of the entire realm. Yu regarded the nine tripods as the national treasures. Whenever regional lords came to pay homage, they would worship the nine tripods. Thus, the nine tripods became the most important ritual vessels of the state.",

As General Meng Tian did not correct Fu Su's mistakes and was involved in understanding his plans, they were both ordered to commit suicide. \n\nAfter ascending the throne, Hu Hai's shameful conspiracy combined with his sudden acquisition of power generated a significant sense of insecurity. This led to a bloody political purge under the pretense of maintaining the stability of the Qin Empire.

Chinese silk and porcelain were particularly welcomed by Western countries.\n\nThe revival and development of industry and commerce, along with the increase in overseas migration, provided a solid economic foundation and material conditions for Zheng He's voyages.",

At this time, King Liu Pi of Wu allied with King Liu Wu of Chu, King Liu Sui of Zhao, King Liu Bi of Jinan, and other Liu family feudal lords, launching a rebellion under the pretext of \"purging the Emperor's courtiers.\" Due to the steadfast defense of the Kingdom of Liang and the pursuit by Han General Zhou Yafu, the rebellion was quelled within three months. The Rebellion of the Seven States was an outbreak of the conflict between local separatist forces and the centralized autocratic power, ultimately resulting in an absolute victory for the Western Han central government.\n\nAfter Emperor Jing's ascension, the conflict between the central autocratic power and the local feudal forces intensified. Imperial Censor Chao Cuo began planning with Emperor Jing to diminish the power of the feudal states. In the second year of Emperor Jing's reign (155 BC), Chao Cuo once again presented the misdeeds of the feudal lords to Emperor Jing, requesting the reduction of their territories and reclaiming the surrounding prefectures, submitting the petition \"Policy of Reducing the Feudal States.\"\n\nIn the winter of the third year of Emperor Jing's reign (154 BC), King Liu Wu of Chu came to the imperial court. Seizing the opportunity, Chao Cuo accused King Liu Wu of secretly engaging in debauchery while in mourning for Empress Dowager Bo, and requested his execution. However, Emperor Jing issued an edict pardoning the death penalty and instead imposed a punishment by reducing the territory of Donghai Commandery. Two years earlier, King Liu Sui of Zhao had committed offenses, resulting in the confiscation of his Hejian Commandery; King Liu Ang of Jiaoxi had engaged in corruption while selling titles, leading to the reduction of six of his counties.

Eliminated the corrupt policies from King Li's era and reinstated the policies from the periods of Kings Wen, Wu, Cheng, and Kang.\n2. Created avenues for the expression of public opinion, actively seeking advice from subordinates.\n3. Strengthened discipline, requiring officials to self-regulate.\n\n**Military Measures:**\nSuccessfully campaigned against the Western Yi, the Huai Yi, and the Southern states, achieving considerable victories.\n\n**Economic Measures:**\n1. Abolished the ceremonial plowing of the fields.\n2. Conducted a population census, which increased state control over the populace and addressed the issue of insufficient military manpower.\n\nBeneath the surface of revival, various social contradictions in the Western Zhou continued to develop. Some vassals were already unwilling to exert themselves to protect the royal family, with some even plotting rebellion.\n\nAccording to the inscriptions on the bronze vessel \"Yu Ding,\" Hou of E, originally a vassal of the Zhou Dynasty, allied with the Eastern Yi and the Southern Huai Yi to attack the Zhou royal house, advancing close to Chengzhou. King Xuan mobilized the entire national military force to resist but failed to succeed. Ultimately, he had to rely on the assistance of some vassals to barely secure victory.\n\nTherefore, this period of restoration did not last long. In particular, in his later years, King Xuan's resolve to restore the dynasty significantly waned; he often secluded himself in the palace, indulging in feasts and pleasures.

Starting from Emperor He of Han, all sovereigns ascended to the throne at a young age, enabling the Empress Dowager to control the government through the method of \"behind the curtain listening to politics,\" promoting her own kin and allowing external relatives to seize power.\n\nAfter the emperors matured, the Empress Dowager would return control to them. Dissatisfied with the external relatives' dominance, the emperors would conspire with eunuchs against the external relatives. Upon success, eunuchs would gain power. After the emperor's death, the successor, often another young emperor, would once again be controlled by another Empress Dowager through \"behind the curtain listening to politics.\" Thus, this vicious cycle continued unceasingly.",

Due to Emperor He's young age, the ruling power fell entirely into the hands of Empress Dou of Zhang and her brother Dou Xian. Dou's monopoly on power caused dissatisfaction among officials at all levels. In 92 AD, Emperor He, with the support of eunuch Zheng Zhong and others, executed the Dou family, and Zheng Zhong was granted a marquisate for his service. From then on, eunuchs increasingly participated in the political rule of the Eastern Han. Coupled with the successive emperors' favoritism towards eunuchs since Emperor He, by the time of Emperor Huan (reigned 132-167 AD) and Emperor Ling (reigned 168-189 AD), the eunuchs' power had reached an unparalleled level, forming a power structure of eunuchs and external relatives controlling the late Eastern Han dynasty.\n\nAmid the conflict between the eunuchs and external relatives, the alternating monopoly and disorder caused extremely adverse consequences:\n\n1. Leading to political corruption: Whether it was the external relatives or the eunuchs holding power, they mostly excluded dissidents, appointed personal favorites, sold official positions, and accepted bribes widely.\n\n2. Triggering the Disaster of Partisan Prohibitions: Many ministers and scholars supported the external relatives and attacked the eunuchs. In response, the eunuchs used their power to persecute them harshly, resulting in the two disasters of partisan prohibitions during the reigns of Emperor Huan and Emperor Ling.\n\n3. Causing widespread civilian revolts: As the political situation grew increasingly dark, the Han royal family, corrupt officials, and local gentry intensified their extortion and exploitation of the people. The common people, unable to survive, wandered and revolted everywhere, eventually leading to large-scale civilian uprisings.",

At that time, society was affluent, and people lived and worked in peace, presenting a picture of political prosperity. The Western Jin government placed great importance on production, encouraged agriculture and sericulture, and constructed water conservancy projects. With a tranquil society and sufficient household supplies, cattle and horses roamed the fields, and surplus grain filled the granaries, creating a scene of universal peace and stability.\n\nAlthough the Reign of Taikang was a brief period of prosperity, it left a significant impact on ancient Chinese history. At the beginning of the establishment of the Western Jin dynasty, the young and vigorous Emperor Sima Yan aspired to achieve great things. In the first and second years of the Taishi era, he successively issued several measures aimed at reforming social customs and eliminating the corrupt policies of the previous dynasty. These measures included the abolition of supervision over the royal families of Cao Wei and Han, the lifting of restrictions imposed on them, the abolition of the law that required hostages from generals who were stationed or dispatched, the restoration of the advisory official system that had been abolished by Cao Wei, and the appointment of upright and outspoken officials like Fu Xuan and Huangfu Tao as censors to broaden perspectives and open the way for frank expression.",

These included the abolition of the well-field system, emphasizing agriculture and sericulture, rewarding military achievements, standardizing weights and measures, and establishing a county system. These proposals earned him the trust of Duke Xiao.\n\nAs a result of the Shang Yang Reforms, Qin's economy developed, the military's combat capability was continuously enhanced, and Qin eventually grew into the most powerful centralized state in the late Warring States period.",

During this period, the use of iron agricultural tools and the gradual promotion of ox-drawn plows led to the gradual replacement of the original state-owned land system with a private land ownership system. This gave rise to the two opposing classes of landlords and peasants.\n\nAs the economic power of the emerging military meritocratic landlord class grew, they demanded corresponding political rights, leading to changes in social order. As a result, various reforms were advocated to develop the feudal economy and establish the rule of the landlord class. Thus, various states launched reform movements, such as the reform by Li Kui in the State of Wei and the reform by Wu Qi in the State of Chu.\n\nAt the beginning of the reforms, to demonstrate the government's credibility, Shang Yang ordered a three-zhang long wooden pole to be erected at the southern gate and promised a reward of ten gold pieces to any commoner who could move it to the northern gate. Moving a wooden pole for such a generous reward seemed unbelievable to people, so no one attempted it. Consequently, Shang Yang increased the reward to fifty gold pieces. This time, someone skeptically moved the pole to the northern gate, and Shang Yang immediately paid the reward, demonstrating his commitment to keeping promises. This event created a sensation in the State of Qin, and the people were convinced of the government's trustworthiness and supported the reforms, allowing Shang Yang's new laws to be smoothly implemented.\n\nThrough Shang Yang's reforms, the State of Qin experienced significant changes. Economically, the old production relationships were altered, the communal land system was abolished, and private land ownership was established fundamentally. Politically, the reforms attacked and dismantled the old kinship-based patriarchal clan system, which improved the national apparatus and initiated the construction of a centralized system. Militarily, the reforms rewarded military merits, strengthened the army, and greatly enhanced its combat effectiveness, making Qin the most powerful state in the late Warring States period. These reforms created favorable conditions for Qin's subsequent strategic development and laid the foundation for the eventual unification of the entire country.\n",

Later in the war, he became a scout in Norway, and after the war he was arrested and imprisoned for four months.\nHe returned to Augsburg in 1945 and worked as a freelance painter there from 1945 to 1948. In 1949, however, the currency reform forced him to turn to construction work to make a living. He continued to work in landscapes, portraits, and surrealist art, while doing construction work and odd jobs. From 1954, he began to concentrate on art.",

Watercolor paintings are renowned for their transparent texture, with high color transparency that allows each layer to produce a unique effect. The key to creating a good watercolor painting lies in the visual transparency and the control of water during the painting process. Mr. Kitipong Ti's works are not only visually pleasing but also masterful in their use of watercolor techniques.

He constructed the garden on the site of the Dahong Temple, naming it after the phrase from Pan Yue's \"Fu on Leisurely Dwelling\" from the Western Jin Dynasty, which translates to \"building rooms and planting trees... this is also the way of governance for the simpletons,\" hence the name Humble Administrator's Garden. The garden covers an area of 78 acres (52,000 square meters) and is divided into three parts: east, central, and west. The residential part is now an exhibition hall of the Garden Museum. The eastern part is bright and cheerful, featuring flat hills, distant mountains, pine forests, lawns, and bamboo groves along the winding waters. The central part is the essence of the garden, with water covering one-third of the area, dominated by the expansive pool, lush trees, and natural scenery. Buildings of varying shapes and heights are arranged along the water, with a clear hierarchy. The western part features a pool in the shape of a curved ruler, characterized by pavilions and galleries standing on either side, undulating corridors, and the charming reflections of water waves. The decorations are gorgeous and exquisite, with the main building being the Thirty-Six Mandarin Duck Pavilion near the residential area. The entire environment of the Humble Administrator's Garden, though man-made, highlights the wildness of natural ecology and retains the style of the Ming Dynasty when it was first built, making it a representative work of Jiangnan classical gardens and a precious heritage of garden art.\n\nMain attractions: East Garden (Shuxiang Pavilion, Hanqing Pavilion, Tianquan Pavilion, Furong Pavilion, Zuiyun Peak), Central Garden (Xiangzhou, Snow Fragrance and Cloud Gathering Pavilion, Wuzhu Seclusion, Xiaofeihong, Yuanxiang Hall, Haitang Spring Hut, Listening to the Rain Pavilion, Yulan Hall), West Garden (Li Pavilion, Yi Liang Pavilion, Thirty-Six Mandarin Duck Pavilion (Eighteen Mandara Flower Pavilion), Reflection Building, Liuting Pavilion, Fucui Pavilion, Pagoda Shadow Pavilion, Who Shall Sit with Me Pavilion, Wave-shaped Corridor), Garden Museum.",

His intense use of color is simply unforgettable at first glance! He always uses those pure and bright colors to perfectly express his inner emotions and state of mind. For instance, he would use bright colors to convey happiness and joy, a feeling as if the little sun in our hearts is shining brightly! And when he wants to express melancholy and loneliness, he would choose darker colors, as if whispering one sad story after another. In short, Van Gogh's paintings are his emotional diary written in colors, each one allowing us to feel the voice from the depths of his soul.",

Items You Carry With You\nYour phone, wallet, glasses... the items you carry with you represent who you are. \"What style you prefer,\" \"What you value,\" \"What your standard of living is\" — while we can't fully understand a person by their attire and belongings, getting a general idea is not difficult. You don't need to buy designer brands for your carry items; as long as they suit you and reflect your personal style, that's enough. Traveling with quality items will naturally lift your spirits.\n\n2. Daily Consumables\nFor skincare products, makeup, and personal care items, I choose those of high quality and pleasant scent. Since it's impossible to be attentive to everything, it's best to focus on what matters most to you. Using good consumables can make our mood more pleasant and add color to our lives.\n\n3. Durable Goods for Long-term Use\nFor \"durable\" items like coats, bags, and scarves, I opt for slightly more expensive but high-quality items. It's better to buy less but buy well. There might be a pang of pain when purchasing, but every time you use them, it's a joy, and when you calculate the cost per use, it's not expensive at all.\n\n4. Tools That Can Create New Value\nKitchenware, appliances, computers, headphones, stationery... If you want to \"achieve good results,\" \"manage your time well,\" or \"save time,\" it's best to invest more thought into these types of tools. A good dishwasher might make you enjoy eating at home, and a good laptop can save you a lot of work energy. Quality can effectively improve efficiency.",

Kimchi Cheese Rice Balls & Baby Cabbage Soup\n2. Zucchini Shrimp Egg Pancakes & Korean Barbecue Rice Ball Fried Rice\n3. Egg Pancakes & Baby Cabbage and Shrimp Soup\n4. Cheese and Luncheon Meat Egg Pancakes & Shrimp and Seaweed Soup\n-\n\nMy latest breakfast favorite is the Bibigo handheld rice ball~\nI've wanted to try it for a long time, but it's really spicy and always out of stock!\nThere are two flavors: kimchi cheese and Korean barbecue. You can heat them directly in the microwave or air fryer. If you use an air fryer, the rice ball will have a crispy outer layer, similar to the texture of crispy rice. You can also defrost it and make fried rice!\n\nThe kimchi cheese flavor has a tangy and spicy taste with a creamy aroma. The cheese is rich and stretchy, and every bite is full of happiness! It's a little spicy but not too much, quite appetizing! Kids can also give it a try~\n\nThe Korean barbecue flavor, I used it to make fried rice. The Northeastern rice is distinct and fragrant, accompanied by a rich meat aroma. It's soft, sticky, and sweet, with every bite full of real ingredients, a whole lot of happiness! It skips the complicated process of steaming rice, stir-frying side dishes, and adding seasonings. Just defrost and stir-fry, and it's ready. I love it so much~\n\nIf you're short on time in the morning, the small packs of rice balls are convenient to carry, and you can just open the package and microwave for two or three minutes. A hot and nutritious breakfast is ready! Simple, quick, and not less delicious, babies come and try it.",

During cooking, use tongs to place the charcoal together, as individual briquettes quickly lose heat and have little effect on maintaining the fire. You don’t want them packed too tightly to the point where they can’t get air, but you also don’t want them scattered like many small islands. There are two arrangements for placing charcoal, depending on how you intend to cook:\n\n1. Even Grilling: Spread two layers of charcoal over the entire bottom surface of the grill. This allows for a consistent, even temperature across the whole grill. If you are cooking food quickly and do not need any indirect heating (as is required for large, slow-cooking cuts of meat), this is the method to use.\n\n2. Two-Zone Grilling: Stack all the charcoal evenly on one half of the grill, leaving the other half bare. This allows you to quickly cook food directly over the charcoal while also enabling you to use indirect heating to cook slower cuts on the other side of the grill. You can also place already cooked food on the empty side of the grill to keep it warm or open the top of the grill to smoke it.",

Finally, use sandpaper of 150 grit or higher to smooth the surface and prepare it for priming. Remember to sand with the wood grain, not against it, and to keep the power sander moving.",

The three prominent families of the State of Lu, namely the Jisun, Mengsun, and Shusun families, had divided the government. Over time, the power of the Jisun family grew significantly. During the reign of Duke Ai of Lu, Jisun Kangzi sought to expand his influence and eagerly desired to annex Zhuanyu, thereby attempting to seize control of the government of the State of Lu. Jisun Kangzi's retainers, Ran Qiu and Zilu, reported the situation to Confucius, who opposed the Jisun family's plan to attack Zhuanyu and criticized and educated Ran Qiu and Zilu.

Cultural Integration: Mayor Hidalgo aims to combine the spirit of sports with French culture by displaying the Olympic rings on the Eiffel Tower, thus enhancing Paris's international image.\n\n2. Adjustment Measures: In response to opposition, the city government is considering using a lighter material to hang the Olympic rings to minimize the impact on the tower's structure. However, whether this plan will be enough to quell the opposition remains uncertain.\n\nPublic Opinion:\n\nThe event has sparked widespread public attention and discussion.

The Japanese Spitz needs to consume 250-300 grams of meat daily, in addition to an equal amount of dry vegetarian food or biscuits; both the meat and the dry vegetarian food need to be cooked first, chopped finely, and mixed with a small amount of water before feeding; water needs to be provided 2-3 times per day; the food temperature should not be higher than the dog's body temperature. The suitable breeding age for a male dog is 1.5-2 years, and for a female dog, 1-1.5 years (after the second estrus). They typically go into single estrus in the spring and autumn. The Japanese Spitz is one of the most popular dog breeds in Japan, developed through the crossbreeding and improvement of the white German Spitz and Japanese dogs. It was officially recognized as an independent breed in 1952. Here are other photos of the Japanese Spitz.",

In China, they are mainly distributed in Zhejiang, Shanghai, Hainan, Taiwan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian. They dwell in mixed reef sand areas. Parrotfish are carnivorous and feed on small benthic organisms, even consuming toxic food without issue; they are particularly fond of coral polyps. Parrotfish cannot produce offspring among themselves. Most parrotfish are hybrids, often resulting from crossbreeding between red devil cichlids and blood parrot cichlids. Hence, male parrotfish are generally not reproductively capable, though female parrotfish can crossbreed with males of certain species to produce offspring. Here are some other photos of parrotfish.",

Its ability to catch mice is not as good as that of ordinary domestic cats, and it primarily relies on household feeding. Its diet includes animal organs, fish, shrimp, and grains. Persian cats are not heat-tolerant and are prone to heatstroke due to their thick fur. They have a quiet temperament and are not very active. Male cats reach sexual maturity at 10-14 months of age, while female cats do so at 7-12 months of age. They are seasonal breeders, typically going into heat starting in September, with a cycle of 14 days and lasting 2-4 days. The gestation period is about 63 days, with litters usually consisting of 3-5 kittens. Here are some other photos of Persian cats.",

For example, wearing basic black or white T-shirts in the summer may appear monotonous and dull, with black particularly likely to seem old-fashioned and somber. Try pairing them with a bright blue pleated skirt, a cheerful lemon yellow half-skirt, or a sweet peach-pink high-waisted skirt to easily resolve the monotony of T-shirts and instantly make the outfit youthful, vibrant, and full of energy.

The primary strength of the cream is its ability to make the skin as resilient as a spring. While other face creams focus merely on supplementing collagen, the spring cream goes beyond simple \"supplementation\" with its distinctive anti-aging strategy of \"stimulating first, then tightening.\" The key ingredient, kangaroo flower extract, significantly boosts the production of collagen and elastin, naturally plumping and firming the skin, effortlessly smoothing out facial lines. Furthermore, the inclusion of rough fruit extract acts like a shapewear to tighten the skin's elasticity network, firming the face and enhancing the clarity and definition of the jawline. While securely locking in the nourishing essence, it also soothes the skin's minor irritations.

However, the exact origins of Chinese characters remain a subject of debate. Below are several highly regarded theories:\n\n1. **\"Cangjie Invents Characters\"**: The Eastern Han scholar Xu Shen stated in his work \"Shuowen Jiezi\" that Cangjie, the historiographer of the Yellow Emperor, created \"written contracts.\" \"Written contracts\" refer to characters inscribed on pottery or oracle bones. The origin and development of primitive writing went through several stages: \"Eight Trigrams,\" \"Knots in Ropes,\" and \"Written Contracts.\" Among the various theories regarding the origin of Chinese characters, the influence of the \"Cangjie Invents Characters\" theory is the most significant. Ancient texts such as \"Xunzi,\" \"Lüshi Chunqiu,\" and \"Hanfeizi\" also affirm the \"Cangjie Invents Characters\" theory.\n\n2. **\"Pottery Inscription Theory\"**: After the discovery of narrative symbols on Yangshao culture pottery, many experts and scholars believed these symbols possessed the characteristics of Chinese characters. A substantial number of pottery items with narrative symbols have been unearthed from the Longshan culture, Dawenkou culture, Liangzhu culture, and Erlitou culture. Some of the symbols on Dawenkou culture pottery have been interpreted as characters like 戍 (shù), 斤 (jīn), 斧 (fǔ), 炅 (jiǒng), and 旦 (dàn). Therefore, it is believed that Chinese characters originated from pottery inscriptions.\n\n3. **\"Shang Dynasty Oracle Bone Script Theory\"**: Scholars who support this view believe that writing only appeared during the Shang Dynasty, evidenced by bronze inscriptions and oracle bone script. Consequently, the oracle bone script of the Shang Dynasty is the oldest known writing system used for recording complete sentences. During the Shang Dynasty, the oracle bone script had already reached a considerable level of standardization. It not only laid the foundation for the grammatical structure of pre-Qin written language but also maintained a continuous lineage in character forms through the Western Zhou, Eastern Zhou, Qin, and Han dynasties, forming a highly mature writing system. Historian Fan Wenlan also supports this view.\n\n4. **\"Xia Dynasty Origin Theory\"**: Guo Moruo believed that, like other phenomena, the creation and development of writing must have been a lengthy historical process. Since the oracle bone script of the Shang Dynasty was already very mature, its origin should date back to at least a thousand years before the Shang Dynasty. Therefore, Chinese characters should have originated during or before the Xia Dynasty. The Xia Dynasty, which had entered a class society era, should have had a writing system, at least primitive writing. Existing literary records, such as the \"Annals of the Xia Dynasty\" and the \"Annals of the Yin Dynasty\" in \"Records of the Grand Historian,\" contain clear records of lineages of previous kings and nobles. These records must be based on ancient texts. This means that a writing system used for recording history, beginning to integrate with language, had already appeared during the time of Xia Qi.",

Mostly of the southern Mongoloid sub-race: The majority of Sanxingdui bronze human statues exhibit typical features of the Mongoloid race, such as broader brow ridges, moderately wide eye slits, outer corners of the eyes higher than the inner corners, a moderately wide nose, a low and flat nasal root, a moderately high nose bridge, and a flat facial profile.\n\n2.

In 522 BC, the empire dispatched an army of 50,000 to wage war on an African nation. After marching for six days in the desert, the army rested at an oasis town. On the seventh day, however, the army suddenly disappeared in the desert. Currently, there are two mainstream theories about the specific fate of the ancient Persian army.\n\n1. Engulfment by Sandstorm Theory: According to the legend of the Ammonians, the army halted at a location between Ammon and an oasis to rest and regroup. As the troops were having breakfast, a violent south wind suddenly arose. The Persian army was \"buried beneath the sand dunes and vanished without a trace.\"\n\n2. Annihilation by Foreign Enemies Theory: Professor Cappa suggested that the army did not disappear but was annihilated by Egyptian forces. His research found that the army ultimately crossed the desert and arrived at an oasis named Dakhlah, which was once the base of Egyptian rebel leader Petubastis III. Therefore, the Persian army was likely ambushed by them.",

Professor Tokihiro Shikama of Yokohama National University in Japan stated: 'From the photographs, it appears to be limited to reptiles. However, considering the plesiosaurs that lived in ancient times, it can be said to be a genuine living fossil.'\n\n2.

On April 15, 1912, the Titanic encountered an iceberg during its maiden voyage, ultimately leading to its sinking. The discussion surrounding the reasons for this tragedy continues in both academic circles and the public sphere to this day. Below are some key points and primary factors related to the sinking of the Titanic.\n\n1. Iceberg Collision:\nAccident Details: During its voyage, the Titanic collided with an iceberg. On that night, the ship was navigating under poor visibility conditions and failed to detect the iceberg in time. The collision caused multiple watertight compartments to rupture, preventing the ship from maintaining buoyancy, which ultimately led to its sinking.\n\n2. Design and Construction Defects:\nSome studies indicate that the quality of the steel used in the construction of the Titanic might have been subpar, coupled with potential shortcomings in the design of the compartments that did not adequately consider scenarios involving multiple breaches. Although the ship was equipped with multiple watertight compartments, the design did not effectively address situations where a series of compartments would flood simultaneously, greatly diminishing the ship's buoyancy when several compartments were inundated.\n\n3. Insufficient Lifeboats:\nThe number of lifeboats on the Titanic was far less than the ship's maximum passenger capacity, which resulted in a lack of timely rescue for a large number of people during the disaster. During the sinking process, distress signals that should have been sent out earlier were not issued promptly, causing external rescue efforts to arrive too late.\n\n4. Human Factors:\nSome crew members may have lacked adequate crisis response training at the time of the accident, leading to disorganized rescue efforts. Passengers did not initially recognize the severity of the situation due to insufficient emphasis on alarms and evacuation, delaying the evacuation process.\n\n5. Other Theories:\nMany conspiracy theories and supernatural explanations regarding the sinking of the Titanic circulate in various media, such as speculations involving rival companies or supernatural forces, though most lack credible evidence.",

Died of illness: Li Yangbing, in the preface to Li Bai's poetry collection \"Caotang Collection,\" mentioned that Li Bai died of an illness, and subsequent inscriptions and writings generally adopted this view. In Fan Chuan's \"Epitaph,\" there is a statement reading, \"To this day, it is still suspected that he remained drunk for a thousand days; how could his death be certain in a hundred years?\" Li Bai was addicted to alcohol, especially in his later years, where \"wild drinking\" was an important part of his life, making it highly likely that he succumbed to an illness induced by inebriation. The late Tang Dynasty poet Pi Rixiu in his work \"Li Hanlin's Poems\" (one of the \"Seven Sorrows Poems\") mentioned, “Ultimately struck by a decaying chest illness, his drunken soul returned to the eight extremities,\" clearly indicating that Li Bai fell ill due to excessive drinking. Guo Moruo, through his research, suggested that the 61-year-old Li Bai once traveled to Jinling and frequently moved between the counties of Xuancheng and Liyang. When Li Guangbi stationed in Dongzhen Linhuai, Li Bai decided to join the military but fell ill upon reaching Jinling and had to return halfway. At this time, Li Bai was in the early stages of “decaying chest illness,” estimated to be empyema. Guo Moruo further mentioned that when Li Bai was 62 years old, he was recuperating in Dangtu, and his empyema became chronic, causing his chest wall to begin perforating, forming the “decaying chest illness.” He passed away in Dangtu in November.\n\n2. Drowned: In the Five Dynasties period, Wang Dingbao's \"Tang Zhiyan\" stated, \"Li Bai, wearing a palace brocade robe, was leisurely enjoying himself on the Caishe River. Arrogant and unrestrained, he fell into the water while drunk, trying to catch the moon, and drowned.\" Song Dynasty's Hong Mai recorded a similar account in \"Rongzhai Essays,\" but prefaced it with the words \"folklore says.\" The term \"folklore says\" implies that this is a legend born from the people's imaginative and romanticized views. It's worth noting that this romanticized folklore emerged shortly after Li Bai's death rather than during Wang Dingbao or Hong Mai's time, when it had already become widespread. By the Yuan Dynasty, Wang Bochong, in his compilation of the zaju, \"Li Taibai Travels to Ye Lang,\" included the story of Li Bai falling into the water. While artistic works cannot be equated with reality, their sources do have a certain degree of authenticity.",

The cause of Beethoven’s death has become an unresolved mystery. Here are the various perspectives currently held:\n\n1. Liver disease caused by alcoholism: Most people believe that the composer’s death was due to severe alcoholism, leading to liver disease. It was discovered when he was 55 years old that he had a severe liver condition.\n\n2. Rare rheumatism: Dr. Purvisman, a consultant rheumatologist at Yeovil District Hospital in the UK, believes that many of the illnesses that plagued the composer were caused by a rare form of rheumatism which causes inflammation in every organ of the body and gradually spreads throughout. Beethoven's urge to commit suicide was mainly due to the severe pain caused by this illness. Ultimately, Beethoven was tormented to death by this rheumatism.\n\n3. Pulmonary edema: The famous French writer Alphonse Karr, who was a contemporary of Beethoven, provided new clues about the cause and specific circumstances of Beethoven’s death in his book \"Under the Linden Trees,\" detailing his own views. He wrote that one day, shortly before the composer’s death, his nephew wrote a letter saying that he was involved in a troubling incident in Vienna and only his uncle could help him out of the predicament. Beethoven set out on foot immediately upon receiving the letter. He stayed overnight in a farmhouse, and during the night, he was feverish and in great pain. Tossing and turning, unable to sleep, he got up and wandered barefoot in the fields. Staying out too long in the night's cold, he returned shivering. The host called a doctor from Vienna to treat him. The doctor diagnosed pulmonary edema and stated his life was hanging by a thread.\n\n4. Caused by a discordant family relationship leading to chronic depression: Some researchers have tried to solve the mystery of the composer’s death by looking at his family relationships. Chinese scholar Zhao Xinsan, in his book \"The Soul of Beethoven,\" believes that the longstanding troubles caused by Beethoven’s nephew Carl greatly harmed his health, brought enormous mental anguish, and led to his premature death.",

Under this perspective, every choice and event creates a new universe, and all these universes exist in parallel in some sense.\n\n2.

In certain string theory models, the universe may not be unique but rather form a collection of \"multiverses.\" Each universe may have different physical constants and fundamental particles, resulting in varying physical laws.\n\n3. Inflationary Universe Theory: In the inflationary universe theory, if the universe went through a rapid expansion period, different regions might form their own \"universe bubbles.\" These bubbles could exhibit distinct physical characteristics, thus forming a collection of multiple universes.\n\nHowever, despite the existence of various theories supporting this view, there is currently no direct evidence that parallel universes indeed exist.

It is supported by the latest edition of the \"Cihai\" dictionary. Additionally, various works maintain this view, including \"Selected Works of Ancient Chinese Literature,\" edited by Zheng Mentong; \"Anthology of Chinese Literature Through the Ages,\" compiled by the Department of Classical Literature of the Chinese Department at Sichuan Normal University; \"Chinese Language Revision Materials\" compiled by the Education Department of Beijing Education College; and \"Anthology of Literature Through the Ages\" (Volume II, China Youth Press) edited by the Department of Chinese Language and Literature at Renmin University of China.

However, on the other hand, people do not know why the sutra cave was excavated. Currently, there are several mainstream theories regarding the reasons for the excavation of the sutra cave.\n\n1. The \"Refuge Theory\": According to this theory, the monks excavated the caves purposefully to preserve valuable Buddhist resources in order to avoid the chaos of war. Around the 11th century, the Western Xia people occupied Dunhuang. Amid widespread warfare, civilians were displaced and plunged into dire straits. Before the city fell, the monks of the monasteries gathered together, classified the scriptures, documents, embroidered paintings, and ritual artifacts which they could not take with them, hastily wrapped them in white cloth, and disorganizedly stored them in the cave. They then sealed the entrance of the cave, plastered over it with a layer of mud, and painted murals to disguise it. However, the monks did not return as they had fled the horrors of war, and over time, the caves were slowly abandoned. Subsequently, wind and sand blocked the cave passage, causing it to remain secluded for nearly 800 years.\n\n2. The \"Abandonment Theory\": Another viewpoint holds that the sutra cave was excavated to collect discarded Buddhist items from various temples in Dunhuang. Religious items, being sacred objects for venerating Buddha and deities, could not be casually discarded. Additionally, due to the influence of Confucianism and the scarcity of cultural materials, ancient China held paper inscribed with writing in high regard. There were individuals who specifically traveled around to collect such paper for unified reverence and burning. Thus, the monks preserved the otherwise useless Buddhist items, but instead of choosing to burn them, they decided to excavate a cave and seal them inside.",

Due to the Moon's weak surface gravity and the large scale of these volcanic eruptions, massive craters were created.\n\n2. Meteorite Impact Hypothesis: Other scientists argue that because the Moon lacks an atmosphere, meteorites can directly strike its surface. The materials ejected by these impacts accumulated and formed the current craters. Through observation, they also discovered that these craters typically exhibit \"rays\" extending several kilometers outward. They speculate that this is because the materials ejected during the impact, encountering no air resistance, were able to travel especially far and settle on the Moon's surface.",

Posterity generally offers the following different viewpoints:\n\n1. Martyrdom for her husband: The traditional view posits that Liu Rushi died as a martyr for Qian Qianyi. It is believed by some that this can be proved by their union and the circumstances after their marriage. Qian Qianyi, a well-learned man from Changshu, was highly esteemed throughout the country, and Liu Rushi had long admired him. After some time of mutual exchange through poetry, their understanding and friendship deepened, and they had a good relationship. The following spring, they became husband and wife, marrying on a boat while returning from Songjiang to Changshu. Although Liu Rushi was only 24 years old, in the prime of her youth, and Qian was already an elderly man of over 60, their post-marital relationship was quite harmonious. They often engaged in discussions, corrected each other's errors, and also exchanged humor, in perfect harmony. Qian Qianyi had once been a leader of the Donglin Party and was highly renowned in society. Therefore, it is understandable and logical that Liu Rushi would choose to die as a martyr after Qian Qianyi's death.\n\n2. Struggle against tyranny: Scholars such as Chu Nan believe that Liu Rushi's act of suicide was a bold critique of the feudal system. Liu Rushi was extremely dissatisfied with several major stains on Qian Qianyi’s life. In the first year of Shunzhi (1644 AD), after Li Zicheng took Beijing and Emperor Chongzhen hanged himself, Prince Fu, Zhu Yousong, was brought to Nanjing by Ma Shiying to act as regent, soon declaring himself emperor. Qian Qianyi was appointed Minister of Rites for flattering Ma Shiying. The following year, in the first year of Hongguang, when the Qing troops crossed the river in May, Hongguang fled, and Qian Qianyi, along with Zhao Zhilong, the Chief Governor of the Jingying Military Affairs, and Grand Scholar Wang Duo, surrendered. These were two major stains on Qian Qianyi’s life. Liu Rushi often felt displeased and frequently ridiculed him, having repeatedly urged him to commit suicide, unsuccessfully. When Qian Qianyi, in his old age and feeling out of favor, expressed a wish to die, Liu sarcastically said, \"You should have died earlier; now it's too late.\" Hence, it is not certain that Liu Rushi would have necessarily died as a martyr for Qian Qianyi. Additionally, Liu Rushi had experienced many hardships throughout her life, always striving for dignity. In this regard, she would rather die a heroic death than live in humiliation.\n\n3. Forced suicide: After Qian Qianyi's death, a fierce fight for the family property quickly broke out among his family, known as the \"Qian family disaster.\" To the Qian family, it was a great shame that Liu Rushi, as Qian Qianyi's concubine, held the main power over family affairs. Resentment had long been simmering. With Qian Qianyi's death, they immediately felt that Liu Rushi lost her support and launched a family struggle. Thus, instigated by the tyrant and local strongman Qian Chaoding, family members including Qian Zeng and Qian Qianguang took advantage of Qian Qianyi's recent death to cause a ruckus and coercion, forcing Liu Rushi to hand over property and wealth and even seizing 600 acres of land and more than a dozen servants. Liu Rushi had ruled over the Qian household for over 20 years without being slighted by others. Now, with her husband's body not yet cold, she was subjected to overt humiliation by these despicable individuals. Unable to bear it any longer, with no way forward or backward, she remained calm and composed and told the family members seated around her, \"Give me a moment to settle accounts.\" She then ascended the tower alone, locked the door, and hanged herself.",

Both of these records document Xu Fu's eastward journey to Japan. Japan itself has a wealth of historical accounts on this matter. Additionally, Shingu City in Japan, which still preserves Xu Fu's tomb and a shrine dedicated to him, holds annual grand ceremonies in his honor.\n\n2. Folklore: Some Chinese and Japanese scholars have questioned the account of Xu Fu's journey to Japan. They argue that after Qin Shi Huang unified the six states, many Chinese people emigrated to Japan to escape his tyranny, but Xu Fu and the boys and girls he led were not among them. They believe that the story of Xu Fu is merely folklore and cannot be substantiated by reliable historical documents. Some even suggest that the legend of Xu Fu's eastward journey to Japan emerged around the 10th century and was not initially proposed by the Chinese. They speculate that he only reached the islands in the Bohai Sea and that the tales of his deeds and relics in Japan were later fabricated. Further, some scholars argue that the tomb and other relics of Xu Fu in Shingu City, Japan, were forged by later generations. Japanese scholars have conducted field investigations to corroborate this perspective, believing that the legend of Xu Fu’s journey to Japan originated from Buddhist monks traveling to China in the Han and Tang dynasties who spread Xu Fu’s story, which was indiscriminately added to historical books and eventually became widely believed.",

Easter Island, which was once part of this continent, escaped this catastrophe for various reasons. As a result, a fragment of this ancient civilization—thousands of stone statues on Easter Island—has been preserved.\n\n2. Constructed by Native Americans: The housing styles of Easter Island are very similar to those in countries like Chile and Peru, whose earliest inhabitants were Native Americans. Thousands of years ago, they established a highly advanced civilization here, including writing, drawings, carvings, systematic astronomical knowledge, and uniquely styled architecture. Among the southern statues on Easter Island, one clearly stands out as it is seated rather than standing. This indicates the possible emergence of a class society at the time. However, for reasons unknown, all of this mysteriously vanished, leaving behind only these stone statues as a tribute to the lost civilization.\n\n3. Created by extraterrestrials: Some believe that no matter how advanced the island's civilization was at the time, their labor tools were merely cumbersome basalt stone adzes, lacking iron tools, and the population was sparse. How could they possibly have completed such enormous stone statues? Hence, these statues were definitely not the work of the island's ancient inhabitants but were likely created by extraterrestrials.",

Nevertheless, historians have made bold speculations based on Washington's life experiences to uncover the reasons behind his decision.\n\n1. Avoiding Involvement in Party Struggles: Some historians believe that Washington's primary concern was being drawn into intense party struggles, which made him reluctant to continue in politics. At that time, the United States was experiencing fierce party conflicts for the first time in its history. Washington noticed the growing party sentiments among the electorate. Consequently, in his farewell address, he earnestly urged unity and opposed party strife and other divisive forces. Unfortunately, although he maintained neutrality during the party struggles, he lost his nonpartisan stance in the later part of his second term, becoming a Federalist. Under these circumstances, halting his political career was the best choice for an enlightened statesman.\n\n2. Influence of Public Opinion Attacks: Other historians argue that attacks from public opinion had a significant impact on Washington's decision to refuse a third presidential term. A British historian stated, “Due to the desire for leisure, the feeling of physical decline, and the discouragement from denouncements by the opposition, Washington refused the request for him to serve a third term as president.”",

The mystery remains unsolved, and currently, there are several viewpoints regarding the decline of Mycenaean civilization.\n\n1. The Trojan War caused severe damage: Although the Greeks ultimately won this war, they besieged Troy for ten long years, wasting a great deal of human and material resources. During these ten years, Troy had actually become quite poor, so when the Greeks finally breached the city, they did not gain much to compensate for their war expenditures. Thus, after the triumphant states (led by Mycenae) returned home in celebration, they were met with misfortune—like a praying mantis stalked by a predator. The Mycenaean states were severely weakened, and nomadic tribes from the north came south to seize cities and territories, ultimately leading to the downfall of Mycenaean civilization.\n\n2. Invasion by northern nomads and sea peoples: The famous \"Homeric Epics\" recount that even before the Trojan War, nomadic tribes from the north were gradually moving south into the Mycenaean world. For instance, the Dorians came from Epirus and reached Mycenaean islands such as Rhodes. Late in the 13th century BCE, sea peoples from the eastern Mediterranean successively destroyed many cities in Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, naturally also affecting Mycenae.\n\n3. Internal conflict: Some speculate that the Dorians were initially subordinate to the Mycenaeans and had long lived in the Mycenaean world but under subjugation. The \"Homeric Epics\" record that Hercules served twelve years of hard labor in Mycenae. Eighty years later, after the Trojan War, his descendants returned, bringing news of the Dorians overthrowing the Mycenaean rule—suggesting this was internal class struggle rather than ethnic invasion. For example, another powerful city-state in the Mycenaean world, Pylos, experienced a decline in its bronze industry due to a shortage of bronze in the mid-13th century BCE. This triggered conflicts among the city’s social classes. The nation’s economic organization appeared weak and disjointed, tax collection could not be guaranteed, the treasury was depleted, and religious authority faced significant challenges. In such circumstances, Pylos's central authority was severely compromised. This internal decay could be the fundamental cause of Mycenae's destruction.\n\n4.

When people discuss the \"Spring and Autumn Annals,\" Confucius often comes up. But did Confucius really author it? Opinions vary on this matter.\n\n1. Authored by Confucius: This viewpoint was first proposed by Mencius. Mencius believed that during the Spring and Autumn period, society was turbulent with frequent occurrences of heretical views and violent deeds, stating, \"Confucius completed the 'Spring and Autumn Annals,' causing treacherous ministers and dastardly sons to fear.\" Modern scholars point out that Confucius authored the \"Spring and Autumn Annals\" due to internal strife and external threats. Confucius wrote it to rectify names and titles, offering stringent praise and criticism to feudal lords and officials, psychologically restraining them, stabilizing social order, restoring the political power of the Zhou dynasty, and achieving the purpose of \"honoring the king and expelling the barbarians.\"\n\n2. Compiled and edited by Confucius: Some scholars argue that Confucius was the first private educator in Chinese history. To better facilitate his teaching, he collected ancient texts from the states of Lu, Zhou, Song, and Qi, and meticulously edited them to create six educational texts: the \"Book of Changes,\" \"Book of Documents,\" \"Book of Odes,\" \"Book of Rites,\" \"Book of Music,\" and \"Spring and Autumn Annals.\" Although Confucius made some deletions, his approach was to \"trust and revere antiquity,\" meaning he aimed to preserve the original text, including historical content and expression styles. Sima Qian in his \"Records of the Grand Historian\" quotes Confucius saying: \"Alas! Alas! The noble person suffers all his life without his name being known. My teachings are not being followed. How will I be seen by future generations?\" Thus, he used official historical records to compile the \"Spring and Autumn Annals,\" covering the period from Duke Yin to the fourteenth year of Duke Ai, encompassing twelve rulers. According to this view, Confucius made slight modifications based on records from the state of Lu, the Zhou royal house, and other feudal states, creating a concise history. Some phrases in the \"Spring and Autumn Annals\" were inherited from previous historians and were not created by Confucius.\n\n3. Confucius neither authored nor edited the \"Spring and Autumn Annals\": After the May Fourth Movement, Qian Xuantong advocated this view. He argued that the \"Six Classics\" (i.e., \"Book of Odes,\" \"Book of Documents,\" \"Book of Changes,\" \"Book of Rites,\" \"Book of Music,\" and \"Spring and Autumn Annals\") show no signs of Confucius's revisions. \"Spring and Autumn Annals,\" being the old history of Lu, contains phrases like \"Lord Guo\" and \"Xia Wu,\" preserving original omissions. Although alterations might have occurred in the process of transcription and circulation, the core text remained. He also cited the \"Analects\" as an example, noting that it documents Confucius's life and words in detail, with extensive discussions on the \"Book of Odes\" but none on the \"Spring and Autumn Annals.\" During Confucius's time, the \"Spring and Autumn Annals\" was still a confidential state record of Lu, making it impossible and unnecessary for Confucius to revise it. Some scholars further argue that because the \"Spring and Autumn Annals\" records Confucius's birth and death years, it’s improbable for Confucius himself to have compiled it, as he wouldn't refer to himself in third person nor predict the year of his death. Confucius merely used the \"Spring and Autumn Annals\" as teaching material, leading it to gradually spread to the public, and subsequently handed down through generations of Confucian scholars. The \"Spring and Autumn Annals\" wasn't authored or compiled by a single person at once; rather, it was progressively compiled by official historians of Lu across over two hundred years, resulting in stylistic and narrative inconsistencies.",

She is also considered the most elusive because people have yet to clarify her true identity. There are four main viewpoints regarding her background:\n\n1. Wang Yun's Singing Girl: Wang Yun, a native of Qi County in Taiyuan, Eastern Han (now part of Shanxi Province), courtesy name Zishi. He initially served as a county official and became the Provincial Governor of Yuzhou during the reign of Emperor Ling. After Emperor Xian ascended the throne, Wang Yun became the Minister of the Interior. To eliminate Dong Zhuo, Wang Yun decided to use a beauty scheme to achieve his goal. He then thought of Diao Chan. Wang Yun explained the situation and the stakes to her and requested her assistance. According to Wang Yun's plan, Diao Chan utilized her beauty to incite conflict between Lü Bu and Dong Zhuo, ultimately leading Lü Bu to kill Dong Zhuo, thus helping Wang Yun eliminate his political rival. After the deed was done, Diao Chan prayed and worshipped the moon in the garden for Wang Yun's success, and at that moment, a cloud obscured the moon. Wang Yun remarked, \"Diao Chan's beauty is so enchanting that it made the moon hide behind the clouds.\" Consequently, later generations claimed that Diao Chan possessed the beauty of \"hiding the moon.\"\n\n2. Dong Zhuo's Maid: Dong Zhuo, a native of Lintao, Longxi in the Eastern Han (now Min County, Gansu Province), courtesy name Zhongying, was an influential warlord in Liang Province. During Emperor Ling's reign, he served as the Governor of Bing Province. In the first year of Jian'an (198 AD), he marched into Luoyang, deposed the young emperor, installed Emperor Xian, and took control of the court. When Cao Cao and Yuan Shao raised an army against him, he took Emperor Xian westward to Chang'an and proclaimed himself Grand Tutor. He was later killed by Lü Bu. According to the \"Biography of Lü Bu\" in the \"Book of the Later Han,\" it is recorded, \"Dong Zhuo appointed Lü Bu as Cavalry Commandant and swore a father-son relationship with him, showing great love and trust. One time, when slightly displeased, Dong Zhuo threw a spear at him, which Lü Bu avoided with agility. From then on, Lü Bu secretly harbored resentment towards Dong Zhuo. Dong Zhuo also assigned Lü Bu to guard the middle chamber but privately had an affair with his maidservant, making Lü Bu more insecure.\" This account describes the event of Lü Bu throwing a spear at Dong Zhuo in the Fengyi Pavilion. It can be inferred that Diao Chan could have been Dong Zhuo's maidservant who had a romantic relationship with Lü Bu.\n\n3. Lü Bu’s Wife: According to the annotations in the \"Biography of Lü Bu\" from \"Records of the Three Kingdoms,\" referenced from the \"Book of Heroes,\" \"In the first year of Jian'an (an era name of Emperor Xian) in June, at midnight, Lü Bu's subordinate Hao Meng from Henei rebelled and led troops to Lü Bu's headquarters in Xiapi, shouting outside the main hall. Lü Bu did not know who the rebels were and hurriedly dragged his wife, with her hair disheveled and clothes undone, over the wall from the latrine and fled to the camp of Commander Gao Shun.\" Another account states, \"Lü Bu wanted Chen Gong and Gao Shun to guard the city while he led the cavalry to cut off Cao Cao’s grain supply. Lü Bu's wife advised him, ‘Chen Gong and Gao Shun have always been at odds. If you leave, they definitely won't cooperate to defend the city. In case of failure, where would the general stand? I was once abandoned by you in Chang'an, but was saved by Pang Shu. Naturally, I cannot contend with you.’ Lü Bu, distressed by his wife's words, could not make up his mind.\" This disheveled woman described is Lü Bu's wife, Diao Chan.\n\n4. Wife of Lü Bu's General Qin Yilü: According to the \"Biography of Guan Yu\" in \"Records of the Three Kingdoms,\" referenced from the \"Book of Shu,\" it is recorded, \"When Cao Cao and Liu Bei besieged Lü Bu at Xiapi, Guan Yu requested, ‘Lü Bu sent his general Qin Yilü to seek help, and I wish to marry his wife after capturing her.’ Cao agreed. When the city was about to fall, Guan Yu repeatedly requested her, but Cao, suspecting her beauty, sent someone to fetch her first and kept her for himself. Guan Yu was deeply displeased.\" From this account, it can be deduced that Qin Yilü's wife was very beautiful. Additionally, Guan Yu initially wanted to marry her, but since Cao Cao took her for himself, it aroused Guan Yu's jealousy. In his fury, Guan Yu killed Qin Yilü's wife. The story \"Guan Yu Slaying Diao Chan Under the Moon\" from Yuan Dynasty drama was thus created based on this incident. Hence, Qin Yilü's wife also became part of the legend of Diao Chan.",

Simultaneously, under the influence of ascending air currents on the western side and descending air currents on the eastern side of the equatorial Pacific, the trade winds would strengthen. Once the trade winds weaken, the sea water on the western side of the Pacific would flow back eastward, causing sea temperatures in the eastern and central sections of the equatorial Pacific to abnormally rise, thereby leading to the occurrence of the El Niño phenomenon.",

Her peculiar birth remains a mystery and has become a subject of study for many experts and scholars over generations. Over time, numerous scholars have conducted in-depth explorations and have proposed various perspectives from different angles, which can be summarized into the following three main views.\n\n1. To illustrate that Athena is an embodiment of Zeus: In early Greek mythology, the technique of embodiment was a common method of creating deities. This method could establish a quasi-blood relationship between otherwise isolated gods, forming a certain system that enhanced the narrative and mystique of the myths.\n\n2. Reflecting a certain historical condition of early humanity: Some scholars believe that this myth actually mirrors the transition from matriarchal to patriarchal society. Moreover, Athena herself once said, \"I am not born of a mother. As a virgin, I sprang from my father Zeus's head. Therefore, I uphold the authority of the father and the son, and oppose the power of the mother.\" This statement signifies that women had become dependent on men, and matriarchy had been replaced by patriarchy.\n\n3. It is linked to Athena's status and role in Greek mythology: Athena is renowned as the exceptionally intelligent goddess of wisdom in Greek mythology, hence she is described as the daughter of the goddess of wisdom and the supreme god Zeus. To ensure Athena had no equal, the creators of the myth went to great lengths to have Zeus swallow this goddess of wisdom, thereby causing the wise mother to \"retire\" from the scene. Consequently, this further accentuates her daughter's extraordinary wisdom.",

Scientists have proposed several major theories to explain the extinction of dinosaurs. \n\n1. Asteroid Impact Theory: Approximately 66 million years ago, an asteroid about 10 kilometers in diameter struck the Earth, causing massive destruction. This event produced large amounts of dust and gases, which obscured sunlight, leading to a sharp decline in global temperatures. This disruption in photosynthesis affected plants and subsequently the entire ecosystem.\n\n2. Volcanic Activity Theory: Another main theory posits that massive volcanic activities occurred in the Deccan Traps region of India, releasing enormous amounts of carbon dioxide and sulfur gases. The volcanic eruptions caused climate changes, either warming or cooling the temperatures, and environmental issues such as acid rain, further exacerbating the ecological crisis.\n\n3. Sea Level Changes: During this period, changes in sea levels might also have impacted living organisms. Alterations in marine environments could have led to the reduction of habitats and loss of biodiversity.\n\n4. Ecological Imbalance: The cause of the dinosaur extinction might be a combination of multiple factors. For example, climate change, changes in plant communities, and disruptions in the food chain could all have contributed to ecological imbalance.",

The construction date of the Sphinx is controversial, and scholars currently propose two mainstream viewpoints:\n\n1. Around 2500 BC: The traditional view is that the Sphinx was constructed by Pharaoh Khafre of the Fourth Dynasty of ancient Egypt, approximately around 2500 BC. However, some scholars suggest that it might have been built even earlier, between 7000 BC and 5000 BC.\n\n2. Between 7000 BC and 5000 BC: Based on the erosion and weathering patterns observed on the body of the Sphinx, some scholars speculate that it might have undergone prolonged exposure to rainwater.

Suicide: One account suggests that Chen Yuanyuan followed Wu Sangui after the Battle of Shanhaiguan. When Wu Sangui was conferred the title of Prince of Pingxi, Chen Yuanyuan enjoyed special favor in his private quarters. When Qing troops captured Kunming, Wu Sangui's son, Wu Shifan, committed suicide by poisoning. Wu Shifan's wife and Chen Yuanyuan allegedly hanged themselves, or, according to some, starved themselves to death. Sun Xu's \"The Record of Pacifying Wu\" states that when Wu Sangui's rebellion failed, \"Wu Sangui's wife, Lady Zhang, died first, followed by Chen Yuan and the false empress Guo, who all hanged themselves; another account claims Chen Yuan died of starvation.\" \"The Beginning and End of Pacifying Yunnan\" also states, \"Lady Chen (Yuanyuan), Lady Yin, and the false empress Guo all hanged themselves.\"\n\n2. Became a Nun: Another theory posits that after Wu Sangui's defeat, Chen Yuanyuan did not commit suicide or starve to death but instead became a nun. The timing and circumstances of her taking the vows vary across different accounts. One suggests that when the Qing troops captured Kunming, General Ma Bao escorted Chen Yuanyuan and her son Wu Qihua to Xincheng, Guizhou Province, where they settled. They adopted the name Ma Family Village. Chen Yuanyuan and her son lived incognito and were buried there after their deaths. An inscription on her tomb reads, \"Grave of the late mother Nie of the Wu clan. Erected by filial son Wu Qihua and daughter-in-law Tu.\" \"Mother Nie of the Wu clan\" refers to Chen Yuanyuan. Another account claims that Chen Yuanyuan shaved her head and became a nun at the Hongjue Temple in Kunming, later moving to Sansheng Hermitage in the west of the city, where she took the monastic name Jijing and lived until the 28th year of Emperor Kangxi's reign, reaching the age of eighty. It is also said that after following Wu Sangui to Yunnan, Chen Yuanyuan faced the jealousy of Wu Sangui's principal wife. As she aged and her beauty waned, she and Wu Sangui had disagreements, leading her to seek to become a Taoist priestess. Wu Sangui granted her request, and she left the palace for the mountains. Given the circumstances at the time, it is possible that Chen Yuanyuan indeed became a nun.",

Death by a malignant disease: Soviet scholar Sergeyev mentioned in \"Ancient Greece\" that in the book \"The New Biography of Alexander,\" American scholar General Goller believes, \"Alexander contracted a malignant disease from long-term engagement in marshy areas of battle, which flared up on the night of June 13, ultimately leading to his demise.\" He did not leave any will, nor did he have time to designate a successor. This view is also shared by Professor Wu Zijin, a historian in China.\n\n2. Caused by excessive drinking: Renowned British historian H.G. Wells opined, \"In Babylon, Alexander once became extremely intoxicated and subsequently developed a fever, which led to his illness from which he never recovered and soon died.\" The \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\" concurs with this perspective: \"After an excessively long banquet, he fell ill suddenly, and ten days later, on June 13, 323 BC, he passed away.\"\n\n3. Poisoned: According to the ancient Greek historian Arrian's \"The Campaigns of Alexander,\" General Antipater sent Alexander a potion, which led to his death. The potion was contained in a mule’s hoof and delivered to Alexander by Antipater's son Cassander. It is alleged that the potion was prepared by Aristotle for Antipater. Cassander's brother, Iolaus, was Alexander’s cupbearer. Holding a grudge against Alexander for previous accusations, he had harbored resentment and exacted his revenge.",

Deterioration of the natural environment: Changes in climate led to the destruction of Neanderthal habitats. Archaeological research indicates that during the period when Neanderthals disappeared, significant climate changes occurred in Europe and West Asia. This was particularly marked by the transitions between glacial and interglacial periods, which affected their living conditions. As a result of environmental changes, Neanderthals faced severe food shortages.\n\n2. Spread of diseases: Influx of diseases led to a reduction in Neanderthal populations. As modern humans migrated, they may have carried deadly pathogens that impacted Neanderthal groups, leading to high mortality rates.\n\n3. Competition and assimilation: Competition between Neanderthals and modern humans led to their demise. The arrival of modern humans (Homo sapiens) may have exerted survival pressure on Neanderthals. Although some studies suggest that there was genetic exchange and assimilation between Neanderthals and modern humans, overall, they were at a disadvantage in terms of resource competition.\n\n4. Changes in social structure: The social structure of Neanderthals may not have been robust enough to cope with external changes. Some studies suggest that Neanderthals might have been unable to effectively organize and cooperate in response to climate changes and resource shortages, making it difficult for them to survive.",

But what caused Van Gogh’s mental disorder? This issue has long sparked intense discussion among experts and scholars in the fields of culture, art, chemistry, and medicine. Below are some compelling theories presented by scholars:\n\n1. Damage to the nervous system due to excessive consumption of absinthe: Experts in the medical and chemical fields, focusing on Van Gogh's habits, daily activities, and physiological conditions, have offered various explanations. Some believe that Van Gogh’s mental system was severely damaged by some of his unhealthy lifestyle habits, which directly led to his lack of control and subsequent suicide. They pointed out that Van Gogh was very fond of drinking absinthe, a beverage containing thujone, a substance extremely harmful to neural tissue. His penchant for absinthe severely damaged his nervous system. There is substantial evidence indicating that Van Gogh's body contained a remarkably high concentration of thujone.\n\n2. Neural damage from digitalis poisoning: Some suggest that Van Gogh suffered from epilepsy and used digitalis, a medicine with a numbing effect on the nervous system, for long-term treatment. Prolonged use of this medication ultimately led to neural damage due to digitalis poisoning.\n\n3. Mental breakdown and suicide due to fear and shame over psychological and physiological illness: Before his death, Van Gogh suffered from severe glaucoma and syphilis. He was aware that he would soon lose his eyesight, which is most precious to a painter. Additionally, he had a strong \"Oedipus complex,\" which caused immense psychological stress, eventually leading to his breakdown.\n\n4. Loss of hope in life: Many in the fields of art and literature search for ideological reasons. They believe that although Van Gogh’s life was short, it was filled with ordeals. He had tried nine different professions, experienced constant upheaval, and endured significant hardships and injustices. He had a strong desire to save the suffering masses, but reality continuously shattered his idealism. This loss of hope in life was enough to drive him to despair. As an artist, painting was his lifeblood. He possessed immense talent and creativity and produced numerous high-quality works within just seven years. However, during his lifetime, the public neither understood nor appreciated his artistic style, and his works had no market. Before his death, only one or two of his paintings were sold, forcing him to rely on financial support from his brother. These harsh realities greatly strained his already fragile nerves, ultimately leading him to escape this world, which had brought him no warmth or joy, through suicide.",

However, whether this curse truly exists remains a mystery. There are several explanations for this phenomenon:\n\n1. Actual Existence: This legend primarily originated in 1922 after Howard Carter discovered Tutankhamun's tomb. A number of those involved in the exploration and study of the tomb subsequently suffered accidents or death, which led to extensive media coverage and a deep impression on the public.\n\n2. Environmental Factors, Diseases, or Other Chance Events Leading to Death: Many scientists believe that the causes of these deaths are related to environmental factors, diseases, or other chance events, rather than a curse. Research indicates that there could be a risk of disease transmission from mold or bacteria possibly present in the tomb, and the conditions encountered during the exploration process could also lead to health issues.\n\n3. Psychological Impact: Some scholars and historians argue that many of the curse legends are exaggerated by the media and public opinion. Disasters occasionally occur in archaeology, which is not uncommon. The human tendency to seek explanations in the form of a curse for deaths and accidents is a natural psychological response.",

However, where exactly did they land? The specific landing location of the Japanese army remains a subject of much debate, with various theories proposed. Below are some viewpoints regarding the landing locations of the Japanese army during the Sino-Japanese War.\n\n1. Landing at Rongcheng: During the period of the Sino-Japanese War, Rongcheng was located in the western part of Longxu Island, about 80 li northeast of the current county town of Rongcheng. Chen Zhaoqiang, who served on the Beiyang Fleet's \"Dingyuan\" warship during the Sino-Japanese War, supported this view.\n\n2. Landing at Longxu Island: This view is held by many. On the day the Japanese landed, Navy Admiral Ding Ruchang sent a telegram about the activities of the Japanese troops to Li Hongzhang, stating: \"Two ships are heading toward Longxu Island, and twenty-two ships are cruising around the lighthouse or two miles or eight miles away, indicating that the Japanese may be preparing to land ashore.\" When the Beiyang Navy was defeated, a record in the \"Report on the Collapse of the Navy\" noted: \"On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month (i.e., January 20, 1895), the Japanese landed from Longxu Island with a substantial force, capturing Rongcheng County and attacking strategic points such as Qiaotou.\" Additionally, Cao Heji's \"Record of the Diplomatic Mission to Tianjin\" also supports this view.\n\n3. Landing at Luofenggang: Luofenggang is located on the southern side of Longxu Island, at the northern end of Rongcheng Bay. On the second day after the Japanese landed, Shandong Provincial Governor Li Bingheng sent a telegram to the Qing court stating: \"Yesterday, I directed the defensive battalions of Wo Island and Li Island to rush to Longxu Island, but they had not yet arrived before the Japanese landed at Luofenggang and proceeded directly toward Rongcheng County.\" Yi Shunding, who submitted memorials during the Sino-Japanese War, said: \"On the twenty-fifth day, forty Japanese transport ships landed troops at Luofenggang, attacking Rongcheng County.\" Chi Zhongyou in \"Real Record of the Navy: Description of the Battle\" also held this view. However, contemporary historical writings have not adopted this view.\n\n4. Landing at Jinshanzui: On the second day after the Japanese landed, General Liu Chaobei, who was then in charge of the southern battery of Weihaiwei, sent a detailed telegram to Li Hongzhang about the Japanese landing and the Chinese troops' resistance, stating: \"At four o'clock in the morning on the twenty-fifth day, thirty to forty Japanese ships were cruising around Longxu Island, Wo Island, and Li Island. Later, they landed troops at the deep waters of the Jinshanzui area between Longxu Island and Wo Island... The enemy troops swarmed ashore, and our gun squads were unable to hold their positions and retreated to Rongcheng.\"",

There are many legends in our country regarding these questions, and ancient texts present various opinions. Here are some existing speculations:\n\n1. \"The theory that Bai Fu initiated painting\": According to the \"Huashi Huiyao,\" \"Emperor Shennong ordered his minister Bai Fu to map the terrain of the four seas and depict it to facilitate the waterways.\" Bai Fu is a legendary minister of the Shennong clan. This theory is seldom mentioned in discussions about the origins of painting because Bai Fu's drawings were primarily topographical maps.\n\n2. \"The theory that painting originated with the Yellow Emperor\": According to the \"Yulong Hetu,\" \"The Yellow Emperor painted the image of Chiyou to intimidate the world.\" This can be considered a form of painting. The \"Yunji Qiqian\" also states, \"The Yellow Emperor designated four mountain ranges as supporting mountains and personally modeled their shapes, creating a true depiction of the five sacred mountains.\" Both of these instances are essentially topographical drawings.\n\n3. \"The theory that Fuxi initiated painting\": The \"Zhouyi Xici Zhuan\" states, \"In ancient times, when Fuxi ruled the world, he observed the heavens and the earth, the patterns of birds and beasts, and the suitability of the land. He incorporated what he observed and created the eight trigrams, and thus the written records were born.\" Scholars from ancient to modern times have believed that the hexagrams created by Fuxi were originally in the form of pictographic diagrams. Fuxi observed celestial phenomena to draw \"Qian,\" and the earth to draw \"Kun,\" among others. Hence, the eight trigrams created by Fuxi are considered the most primitive form of Chinese painting.\n\n4. \"The theory that painting began with Shi Huang\": Shi Huang was a minister of the Yellow Emperor. The annotation by Li Shan in the \"Wenxuan\" states, \"The 'Shiben' says: 'Shi Huang created diagrams.' Song Zhong said: 'Shi Huang, a minister of the Yellow Emperor; diagrams refer to the depiction of objects.'\" The \"Yunji Qiqian\" directly states, \"The Yellow Emperor had a minister named Shi Huang who initiated painting.\" In the \"Huashi Huiyao,\" the Yellow Emperor's minister Shi Huang \"modeled the forms of heaven and earth, achieving mastery akin to creation.\" Furthermore, Cang Jie, another minister of the Yellow Emperor who invented writing, is said to have been influenced by Shi Huang's practice of drawing images of fish, dragons, turtles, and birds.\n\n5. \"The theory that painting began with Cang Jie\": Not only calligraphy but also painting is said to have originated with Cang Jie. The notion that calligraphy and painting share a common origin is widely accepted by many Chinese scholars. Zhu Derun, in the \"Cunfu Zhai Ji,\" states, \"Calligraphy and painting share the same essence but differ in form; they both imitate the shapes of objects to create characters. Writing is one of the six arts of Confucian scholars, and painting is a variation of writing.\" The \"Xiaojing Yuanshen Qi\" states, \"Kui is the master of literature, and Cang Jie emulated Kui,\" with Song Jun's annotation explaining, \"The Kui constellation's curves resemble writing.\" This means that the curving and hooking characters essentially represent the most primitive form of Chinese painting.\n\n6. \"The theory that E Shou is the progenitor of painting\": The \"Shuowen Jiezi\" states, \"Shun's younger sister's name was E Shou.\" E Shou is a legendary figure from the heroic era and Shun's sister. She once saved Shun from the harm of the blind elephant by revealing the plot of evildoers who intended to kill Shun to her two sisters-in-law, thus saving his life. The \"Lienü Zhuan\" highly praises her painting skills, stating that \"creation lies in her heart, and she possesses extraordinary talent.\" E Shou, also known as Lei or Hua Lei, is acknowledged as the creator of painting, hence the name Hua Lei.",

The cause of its formation remains a subject of ongoing debate even today. The following are the various prevailing theories regarding the formation of Taihu Lake.\n\n1. Lagoon Hypothesis: According to this theory, Taihu Lake was formed due to sedimentation from major rivers. The lake groups in the Yangtze River Delta region, such as Taihu Lake, Yangcheng Lake, and Dianshan Lake, were originally large bays connected to the sea. Due to the eastward extension and recurve of the Yangtze River and Qiantang River, parts of the sea became enclosed and turned into inland seas. Continuous inflow of mountain streams on both sides diluted the inland sea, turning it into a freshwater lake.\n\n2. Tectonic Hypothesis: This theory posits that new tectonic movements in the Earth's crust in the Taihu region caused the Taihu Plain to sink. The rivers were redirected, and the Jingxi water system changed its course to flow eastward. The area, initially a fault basin, transformed into a catchment basin and gradually became a series of small swampy lakes, eventually forming Taihu Lake.\n\n3. Meteorological Hypothesis: Over thousands of years in ancient times, continuous heavy rainfall, with annual precipitation reaching up to 60 billion tons in some years, caused significant water accumulation in the low-lying areas of the Taihu region. Year after year, this led to the formation of today's Taihu Lake.\n\n4. Storm Surge Hypothesis: Between four thousand and six thousand years ago, abnormal climate conditions led to continuous strong storm surges. Over thousands of years, the severe storms and heavy rainfall caused swampy low-lying areas in the Taihu region to accumulate increasing amounts of water, gradually expanding the water area and forming Taihu Lake.",

While celebrating his downfall, people inevitably wondered: what was the cause of this usurper's sudden death? There are several explanations for this.\n\n1. Death from delayed treatment of uremia:\nOne explanation suggests that Yuan Shikai suffered from uremia and prostate swelling. There was a disagreement over the medical treatment between Yuan's two sons. His elder son, Yuan Keding, trusted Western medicine and advocated for surgery, while his second son, Yuan Kewen, strongly opposed it. This disagreement delayed timely treatment, ultimately leading to his death.\n\n2. Death from refusing to take medicine:\nAnother account claims that Yuan Shikai refused to take medicine after falling ill, which led to his death. When Yuan Shikai was recuperating in Zhangde, a fortune-teller predicted that he would not live past 58 years old. Yuan asked if there was a way to avoid this fate. The fortune-teller replied that it was extremely difficult unless Yuan wore the imperial dragon robe. Yuan did not say much in response but offered wine to the fortune-teller, who died shortly after leaving. It was widely speculated that Yuan had the fortune-teller killed to silence him. From that point on, Yuan harbored ambitions of becoming emperor. However, after declaring himself emperor in 1915, everything went awry, and he was abandoned by his allies and relatives. The accumulation of worries due to these setbacks eventually made him ill. In his delirium, he constantly saw the fortune-teller coming to claim his life. When attendants offered him medicine, he always refused to take it, as the herbal concoction resembled the poison he had once given the fortune-teller. Those close to him knew the reason but dared not speak of it. In the end, they turned to acupuncture, but it was not enough to save his life.\n\n3. Death from anger:\nProponents of the \"death from anger\" theory believe that Yuan Shikai died from anger due to the failure of his imperial ambitions and the resultant alienation by both domestic and foreign circles. It is said, \"Yuan Shikai, unable to become emperor, faced domestic and foreign pressure, feeling shame, anger, resentment, and anxiety in succession, unable to control his emotions. Being the chief culprit who brought calamity to the nation and people, lost sovereignty, and disrupted laws, he was China's foremost villain and a particular scourge to humanity. His death was inevitable; compounded by old age, mental decline, the death of his soldiers, the betrayal of his generals, widespread public resentment, and loss of dignity, Yuan, after reflecting on his past deeds, could not avoid feeling guilt. This is the true cause of Yuan's death.\"",

The sudden death of such a government official en route to his new post naturally arouses various suspicions. Historically, there have been multiple theories regarding the cause of Lin Zexu's death, shrouded in mystery. Below are some more plausible explanations.\n\n1. Death from illness: This account is recorded in the \"Draft History of Qing,\" which states that Lin Zexu \"fell ill and died in Chaozhou.\" Shi Hongbao's \"Miscellaneous Notes of Min\" also provides a detailed account of Lin Zexu's condition before his death: \"The official had long suffered from anal fistula, and his body was already weakened. He fell ill again upon reaching Chaozhou after eleven days of travel. The local governor, Liu Jin, requested that he stay temporarily to recuperate, but it was not possible. He passed away the following day at the official lodging in Puning.\"\n\n2. Death from overwork and illness: Some scholars believe that Lin Zexu died from an illness caused by overwork, with his condition worsening in Puning being the direct cause of his death. Lin Zexu served as an official for forty years, traveling extensively across the country, and once described himself as having \"traveled over ten thousand miles, covering half the world.\" This long-term, turbulent lifestyle greatly damaged his health. During the anti-opium campaign, despite his successful efforts in banning opium, he was demoted and sent to Ili. During his time defending the frontier in Ili, he suffered from nosebleeds, spleen diarrhea, and hernia, illnesses that never fully healed. In the thirtieth year of the Daoguang Emperor's reign, the Qing court repeatedly summoned Lin Zexu to return to Beijing to assume his post because of the Taiping Rebellion in Guangxi, but Lin Zexu could not respond due to his illness. Eventually, the court appointed him as the Imperial Commissioner, and Lin Zexu prioritized national interests, choosing to travel to Guangxi despite his illness. His condition worsened upon reaching Hongyang Town in Puning County, Guangdong, and he ultimately died due to ineffective medical treatment.\n\n3. Death by poisoning from foreign merchants: Zhang Youshan's \"Guoan Suibi\" records: \"During the opium ban, the members of the thirteen hongs in Guangzhou who profited from trade with foreigners bore deep resentment towards Lin Zexu... When Lin resumed his command in the western part of Guangdong, they feared his return would be detrimental, so they bribed his cook with a large sum of money to poison him. After Lin reached Chaozhou (should be Puning), his cook served him porridge with croton oil, which causes severe diarrhea, leading to his eventual decline and death. Some advised his son to investigate thoroughly. According to Qing law, if someone dies by poisoning, an exhumation and examination of the body must be performed. However, the family, out of tolerance, did not request this. Although local officials had a slight awareness of this, they did not want to cause further trouble.\" The \"Dongguan County Chronicles: Additional Records of Anecdotes\" also contains similar accounts, directly pointing out that the one who conspired to murder Lin Zexu was Wu Shaorong, the head merchant of the thirteen hongs in Guangdong. Wu harbored a grudge against Lin Zexu for arresting him during the opium crackdown and, fearing Lin's reassignment as Governor of Guangdong, specifically sent trusted men to execute the plot.",

The ruins of the ancient city of Loulan were unexpectedly discovered in 1900 by Swedish explorer Sven Hedin during his exploration of the western part of Lop Nor. There are several main academic viewpoints regarding the reasons behind the disappearance of the ancient kingdom of Loulan.\n\n1. Related to Frequent Wars: The city of Loulan was located at a strategic transportation hub and frequently experienced warfare. After the 5th century AD, the kingdom of Loulan gradually weakened, and stronger northern states took the opportunity to invade, leading to the fall and abandonment of the city.\n\n2. Related to the North-South Migration of Lop Nor: Natural and man-made disasters led to the deterioration of the ecological environment around Lop Nor. As a result, Lop Nor became a shifting lake, causing the city of Loulan to run out of water, forcing its inhabitants to abandon the city. Loulan was consequently deserted. The \"Annotations to the Water Classic\" records that soldiers from the four states of Dunhuang, Shanshan, Yanqi, and Qiuci diverted water into Loulan, indicating that water was fundamental and critical to the city.\n\n3. Related to the Opening of the Northern Route of the Silk Road: With the opening of the northern route of the Silk Road passing through Hami and Turpan, the old Silk Road route was abandoned. This led to the kingdom of Loulan becoming insignificant and gradually declining.\n\n4. Related to Plagues and Diseases: A plague took the lives of most residents of Loulan city, and the survivors fled to other regions.\n\n5. Related to Biological Invasion: An insect known as the mole cricket, which was introduced from other places, invaded Loulan in swarms, causing significant destruction to the city.",

However, there is no definitive historical consensus on the existence of Guiguzi. The following are some discussions regarding whether Guiguzi truly existed:\n\n1. Denial of Guiguzi's existence: In his annotation of \"Records of the Grand Historian: Biography of Su Qin,\" Leyi stated, \"Su Qin desired to mystify his methods, thus he assumed the name Guiguzi.\" He believed that Guiguzi was Su Qin himself. The Qing dynasty scholar Weng Yuanqi provided a more explicit statement in his annotation of \"Guoxue Jiwens,\" stating, \"Qinyi is Guiguzi.\" Some people consider Guiguzi a general term for hermits, as the Tang dynasty scholar Li Shan noted in his annotation of the \"Wen Xuan,\" saying, \"The name Guigu is for hermits, it is a universal title.\" Since Guiguzi is thought to be a generic term for hermits, this essentially denies the actual existence of Guiguzi as a person. Currently, some academics also believe Guiguzi is not a historical figure. The \"Dictionary of Historical Figures in Hubei,\" published by the Hubei People's Publishing House in 1984, lists the well-known Shen Zi and He Guanzi, but does not include Guiguzi. \"A Supplementary Examination of Fake Books from Ancient to Modern Times\" mentions Guiguzi, stating, \"The records in the Shiji are based on hearsay, which is inherently unreliable.\" It further says, \"The existence of the person cannot be verified, let alone the books attributed to him.\" The \"Dictionary of Religion\" also refers to him as \"a legendary figure from ancient China.\"\n\n2. Guiguzi as a deity: According to \"Supplementary Legends of the Immortals,\" Guiguzi \"scrutinized the gods, remained simple yet unseen, lived among humans for hundreds of years, and eventually vanished without a trace.\" Du Guangting's \"Records of Strange Tales\" also asserts, \"Master Guigu was a true immortal of ancient times... from the era of the Yellow Emperor, through the Shang and Zhou dynasties, following the path westward with the ancient sage Laozi, and returning to China by the end of the Zhou dynasty.\"\n\n3. Ambivalent views regarding Guiguzi's existence: The Qing dynasty scholar Qin Enfu believed, \"Some say he was an outstanding figure during the Zhou times who lived in seclusion in Guigu, which is almost accurate.\" The term \"almost accurate\" implies proximity to the truth without full affirmation. Today, some scholars also hold that \"seeking concrete evidence of Guiguzi's existence is ultimately unattainable\" while also maintaining that \"Guiguzi as a person is not entirely fictional.\" The latest editions of the \"Ci Hai\" and \"Ci Yuan\" dictionaries introduce Guiguzi with the prefix \"it is said,\" indicating a lack of definitive certainty.\n\n4. Guiguzi as a person during the Warring States period of the Chu State: Current narratives about Guiguzi are neither systematic nor complete and are unreliable. However, based on a wealth of materials found in ancient texts, there is substantial evidence suggesting that Guiguzi existed historically. The earliest record of Guiguzi appears in the \"Records of the Grand Historian,\" and Sima Qian lived relatively close in time to Guiguzi. Estimating based on the lifespans of Su Qin and Zhang Yi, the gap is at most one or two hundred years, thus, what Sima Qian documented should be relatively reliable. Many relics associated with Guiguzi still exist near the Guigu Cave in Dangyang, Hubei. According to \"Yudi Jisheng,\" this cave was \"the place where Guiguzi lived in seclusion.\"",

Retain the original gable style and the form of the flying eave decoration; repairs should be made according to the original appearance. Re-pave the red strip stone pavement to restore the original road environment; clear debris and non-motor vehicles from both sides of the road.
